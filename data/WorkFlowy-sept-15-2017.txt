                - we are different that other
                    - not traditional educaiton like knewton
                    - or bootcamps like ..
                    - we are afterschoolers with tested curriculums; opensourced and modfied data, accumulated knowledged curated by expert joyful writers who transform hard concepts into easily memorable concepts with memise and tips and tricks , interactive courses
                    - choose: niche market: google mine trending how to guides and all that grap, i do the extensive research for people
                    - target audience: afterschool looking for interest, carreer change
                - different course forms: from quick intro, to delve deeper, to delve super deeper, until you go with that robot to the deepest underground
                - I personally believe videos are too inactive, some try nice with questions but learning by video snippet and answer questions intervals is not the way, we do, and we do, and learning by typing and reading is too limited; we -> i believe in interactive learning books (create ipad) that are hypertext, intuitive user interfaces and navigation schemes, guided learnin with voice; a teach overhead next to you leaning in giving advice! 
                - you can choose learning topic difficulty level
                  "option per sections, depending what you grasp better"
                    - more/less technical outline
                    - more/less discriptive with images etc
                    - 'uitleg' in 3, 6, or 10 senteces dfficulty level
                - learn book also ahs Discourse integrated discussion
                - supermemo algorithms for learning retention

                          "body of a method, 'this' =>evals the object on which the method was invoked"
                        - Expressions
                            - primary exprs: literals ( include no simpler expressions) + some reserved words + regex + bare var reference
                            - array initializer: 'var emptyA = [] ' -> ' [ x, y,z] '
                            - object init: ' var empty) = { } ' -> ' {property : value} '
                            - function def: ' var fun = function(x) { return true; }
                        - Property Access Expressions
                            - expression . identifier
                            - expression [ expression ]
                        - Invocation Expressions
                            -  Every invocation expression includes a pair of parentheses and an expression before the open parenthesis. If that expression is a property access expression, then the invocationis known as a method invocation . In method invocations, the object or array thatis the subject of the property access becomes the value of the this  parameter while the body of the function is being executed.
                        - Object Creation Expression
                          "creates a new object and invokes a function (called a constructor) to initialize the properties of that object."
                            - object creation exp evaluated -> 1st new empty object -> invokes constructor with arguments - the new object = (value of ) this; function can use 'this' to initialize properties of the newly created object  -> value of the obj creation expression is the newly created and initialized object!
                        - Arithmetic Expressions
                            - Non-numeric operands that can't convert to numbers convert to 'NaN' value
                        - Relational expressions
                            - JS objects are compared by reference
                            - JS strings are sequences of 16-bit integer values, and that string comparison is just a numerical comparison of the values in two strings
                            - 'in' operator excepts left-side operand to be a value convertible to string and right-side operand that is in an object
                            - <object> instanceof <constructor>

                          This article provides you with a rigorous roadmap on how to learn advanced JavaScript. The skills you will learn in this course of study will free you from the constrains of using the limited JS techniques you have been using to develop JS applications, and they will give you new insights and new techniques to program JS applications more efficiently, more precisely, and more optimally.
                          If you are new to JavaScript and you are an experienced programmer in another langauge such as Java, Python, ActionScript, Rails, PHP, etc., it is important that you learn JavaScript properly. JavaScript has many idiosyncracies and uncommon concepts that you must know well before you follow this Intermediate to Advanced JavaScript course.
                          
                          What Topics Comprise Intermediate and Advanced JavaScript?
                          Intermediate and Advanced JavaScript topics include:
                          — Debugging JS code, Object-oriented JavaScript
                          — Advanced Functions: Callback functions, Bind, Currying, Higher-order functions,
                          — Asynchronous execution, timers,
                          — JavaScript Patterns for
                          — And more (will be updated in a day or 2).
                          
                          Why Should I Learn Advanced JavaScript?
                          If you work as a font-end developer or you plan to develop JavaScript applications, libraries, or frameworks, it is essential that you understand the aforementioned advanced JavaScript topics, because you will not be able to develop complex JavaScript applications without knowing them.

                          We are using 3 books; fear not: all three of the books are short reads. So the reading is relatively light; we can carry on with our weekly customs as we study advanced JavaScript in 3 weeks. Here are the books we are using (the 3 books will cost just over $60):
                          
                          Effective JavaScript: 68 Specific Ways to Harness the Power of JavaScript—My Favorite JavaScript book.

                          The Roadmap to Advanced JavaScript
                          You will learn just about all the JavaScript advanced techniques and details about JavaScript’s most important concepts that you will use often as a JavaScript Developer.
                          
                          If you don’t have enough time to commit to read the books in 3 weeks, try to do it in no more than 6 weeks. The longer you take, the harder it will be for you to grasp and remember everything you will learn.
                          
                          Get WebStorm, If You Don’t Have It
                          If you plan to be a JavaScript developer or use JavaScript often, you should take a break now and download a trial copy of WebStorm.
                          
                          It is unquestionably the best editor (IDE) for programming JavaScript. It costs $49.00 when your 30-day trial period expires, but it is probably the best investment you will make as a JavaScript developer, besides buying the books you are using in this course and learning advanced JavaScript.
                          Make sure you set WebStorm to use JSHint. JSHint is “tool to detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code and to enforce your team’s coding conventions.”[1].
                          Moreover, WebStorm is a world-class, professional-grade IDE for coding professional JavaScript web applications, so you will use it a lot. And it integrates Node.js, Git, and other JavaScript frameworks, so even after you have become a rock star JavaScript developer, you will be using it, unless a more compelling JavaScript IDE comes out in the next few months.
                          It is fair that I also mention Sublime Text 2, which is the next best JavaScript editor. But it is not as feature rich and complete (even with numerous add-on packages) as WebStorm. I use Sublime Text 2 to make small edits to files of different programming languages, including JS files. But I don’t use it to program full JavaScript web applications.
                          Week 1 (Essential JavaScript Tips and Techniques)
                          Read the entire Effective JavaScript book.
                          This is my favorite JavaScript book. Every page is packed with incredible tips and insightful techniques. I kept whispering, “A Ha,” on many pages.
                          Week 2 (Complete JavaScript Ninja Training)
                          Read the entire Secrets of The JavaScript Ninja book.
                          Week 3 (Adv. Functions, Design Patterns, And More)
                          I have not read this particular book, but the topics seems ideal for this intermediate to advanced JavaScript roadmap. I do plan to read it, though. It is neither a dense nor a long read, so you can read the entire book in one week. Read the entire JavaScript Patterns book.
                          This is optional: Since there are a few hours to spare in this week, you should have enough time to watch Douglas Crockford’s Advanced JavaScript Videos.
                          Further Reading
                          The following books provide additional advanced topics that you must know well if you do indeed want to be a an advanced JavaScript developer. Why come 90% of way, take it home the last 10% with the following books.
                          
                          High Performance JavaScript (Build Faster Web Application Interfaces)
                          Test-Driven JavaScript Development
                          Final Words
                          JavaScript is a fun and lovable programming language, and with it, you will be able to quickly develop sophisticated web applications that hundreds of millions of users can use within hours of completion. There is much satisfaction from being a JavaScript developer, and indeed much pleasure. Share some of your newly acquired advanced JavaScript skills with others and be a good steward for advancing the web and creating applications that users love.
                          
                          To become an advanced JS programmer you need a combination of real-world programming experience at all levels and in various forms (developing disparate applications with myriad technologies, libraries and frameworks), and implementation of the advanced techniques learned. So it is imperative that you put the skills and techniques you have learned from this course into practice—when you are developing web applications.
                          
                          Have fun developing and keep coming back, for there is still much for you to learn on JavaScriptIsSexy.com  "

                            - What is an Object?
                                - Object: unordered list of name-value pairs
                                  "var myFirstObject = { firstName: "Dijon", lastName: "Kock";}"
                                    - primitive data reference are called 'properties'
                                    - functions are reference called methods
                                - Object Acess: 
                                    - objectName.propertyName (for all types, except number) 
                                    - objectName["propertyNumber/Name"]
                                - Usage:
                                    - storing data & custom methods/functions
                            - Obj Reference Data Type (pointer) and Primitive Data Types(actual copy of assigned value)
                            - Obj Data Properties
                              "have 3 attributes; by default  set to 'true' (+ Obj Accessor Props included in ECMAScript5 )"
                                - configurable atrb
                                  "specifies wether prop can be deleted or changed"
                                - enumerable atrb
                                  "specifies wether prop can be returned in a for-loop"
                                - writable atrb
                                  "spec wether prop can be changed"
                            - Creating Objects
                                - 1. Obj Literals (notation)
                                    - var objName = { propName : value, ... } //data is optional, can be empty init too
                                      "values can be any of the data types from prim too obj self, arrys and also func"
                                - 2. Obj Constructor
                                  "constrc is a func used for init-ing 'new' obj"
                                    - var mango = new Object(); mango.propertyName = value;
                                - Practical Patterns
                                    - Constructor Pattern
                                      "basic inheritance template"
                                        - Design: create a object template via func;  the func returns a string in Obj Lit not with parameters/arguments filled in as values to the this.names (name-value pair) assignment in the function body
                                          "code: http://tmblr.co/ZDu7wsez1R3H"
                                            - call: "var objName = new funcName(values); //these vals are called args"
                                        - Inheritance: the pattern encapsulates all the functionalities and characteristic of the object in the single object template function
                                          "because of scope, parsetime vs run time, func declaration before at parse scope while objst are assignments that are created during runtime after func decl has been instantiated and follows by inheriting"
                                        - inherited property: is defined on the object’s prototype 
                                          "property.someObject.prototype.firstName = “rich”;"
                                        - own property is defined directly on the object itself 
                                        - access a property: object.propertyName
                                          "console.log(objName.propName); //'returns some value'"
                                        - invoke a method;  object.methodName()
                                    - Prototype Pattern
                                        - 
                            - How to Access Properties on an Object
                              "Accessing a property on an object that does not exist will result in undefined!"
                                - Dot Notation
                                - Bracket Notation
                            - Own and Inherited Properties
                              "own -> defined on obj ; inherited -> form object's Prototype obj"
                                - check up prototype ladder
                                    - var school = {schoolName:"MIT"};
                                      "// Create a new school object with a property name schoolName"
                                    - console.log("schoolName" in school);  // true
                                      "// Prints true because schoolName is an own property on the school object"
                                    - console.log("toString" in school);  // true
                                      "// Prints true because the school object inherited the toString method from Object.prototype. "
                                - hasOwnProperty method
                                  "useful for:  enumerate an object and you want only the own properties, not the inherited ones"
                                    - console.log(school.hasOwnProperty ("toString"));  // false
                                      "// Prints false because the school object inherited the toString method from Object.prototype, therefore toString is not an own property of the school object."
                                - Accessing and Enumerating Properties on Objects
                                  "To access the enumbl(own and inherited) properties on objs, you use the for/in loop or a general for loop"
                                - Accessing Inherited Properties
                                  "Props inher from Object.prototype are not enum. so t,e for/in loop does not show them. However, inherited properties that are enumerable are revealed in the for/in loop iteration."
                            - Deleting Properties of an Object
                                - To delete a property from an object, you use the delete operator. 
                                - cant delete inherited props, nor can props with their attributes set to configurable
                                  "You can delete a prop of an instance if the propis an own prop of that instance"
                                - able to delete the inherited properties only via the prototype object (where the properties were defined)
                                - cant delete properties of the global object declared with var keyword.
                                - delete objectInstance.propertyName;
                            - Serialize and Deserialize Objects
                              "code examples: http://tmblr.co/ZDu7wsezEgo6"
                                - deserialize: convert string to obj - use to transfer objects via HTTP
                                  "JSON.parse function"
                                - serialize: convert obj to string 
                                  " JSON.stringify function"

                          "http://goo.gl/tRhtK"
                            - Prototype Property - every JS function has one (empty) by default
                              "props and methods  are atteched to this prot prop for inheritance implementation (not enum)"
                                - inheritance: you add methods and properties on a function’s prototype property to make those methods and properties available to instances of that function
                                  "code example: http://tmblr.co/ZDu7wsez7sZN"
                            - Prototype Attribute - obj prot attrb points to “parent”/inherited the props
                              "aka prot obj; Every object inherits properties from parent =  object’s prototype attribute"
                                - Objs have attrb too (just like objs properites have attrb)
                                  " prototype, class, and extensible"
                            - Constructor: "function Account () { }; var var userAccount = new Account (); "
                              "//use of Account constructor to create the userAccount object"
                                - alll objects inherit a constructor form parent obj that points to constrct
                                  "console.log(userAccount.constructor); // Account()// Finds the userAccount object's constructor
                                  "
                            - Prototype Property: Prototype-based Inheritance
                                - Prototype is important in JavaScript because JavaScript does not have classical inheritance based on Classes (like most object oriented languages do), and therefore all inheritance in JavaScript is made possible through the prototype property. JavaScript has a prototype-based inheritance mechanism.
                                - create a Fruit function (an object, since all functions in JavaScript are objects) and add properties and methods on the Fruit prototype property, and all instances of the Fruit function will inherit all the Fruit’s properties and methods
                                - Nifty code example: http://tmblr.co/ZDu7wsezB0rK 
                            - Prototype Attribute: Accessing Properties on Objects
                                - prototype chain: the chain from an object’s prototype to its prototype’s prototype and onwards
                                  "if cant find prop in nested object's prototype-> return "undefined""
                                - Object.prototype Properties Inherited by all Objects
                                  "All objects in JavaScript inherit properties and methods from Object.prototype. "
                                    - These inherited properties and methods are: constructor, hasOwnProperty (), isPrototypeOf (), propertyIsEnumerable (), toLocaleString (), toString (), and valueOf ().
                                    -  ECMAScript 5 also adds 4 accessor methods to Object.prototype

                                - Function Declaration - during parsetime
                                  "can be accessed by interpreter as it is being parsed"
                                    - JS 'hoists' func decs to the top of the current scope during parsetme
                                    - Two declarations of the same name no matter how they are nested the last one is evaluated
                                      "because parsetime top to bottom through all declarations beforehand"
                                - Function Expression (part of an assignment expression) - during runtime
                                  "can't be accessed/evaluated until the variable assignment has been completed"
                                    - Exception is thrown if function is invoked before assignment is completed
                                - If one assigns a function declaration to a variable because it is a assignment expression it is given its own scope; they become seperate entinties [see code]
                                - function declarations can not be conditionally defined. If you need conditional definition use a function expression !  [see code]
                                - never declare a function decleration inside a control flow statement!
                            - Function Scopes
                                - Many languageS: scoped to the block
                                - Javascript: scoped to the function! ( block level through closures? )
                            - Debugging Functions
                                - optional to name a function expression -> why then? -> debug
                                - Named function expressions have access to their name within the newly defined scope, but not in the enclosing scope.
                                - Nameless function expressions -> stack trace -> "(anonymous function)"

                            - Creating a constructor had to be simple (in this case simply providing an init method does the trick).
                            - In order to create a new ‘class’ you must extend (sub-class) an existing class.
                            - All of the ‘classes’ inherit from a single ancestor: Class. Therefore if you want to create a brand new class it must be a sub-class of Class.
                            - And the most challenging one: Access to overridden methods had to be provided (with their context properly set). You can see this with the use of this._super(), above, calling the original init() and dance() methods of the Person super-class.

                                    - Ryanair demands a lot of its pilots. They work hard and are expected to show a professional discipline at all times. Ray makes clear what the SOPs are, including fuel (much in the news last year). I’ve been through the fuel guidelines with a finetooth comb and there’s nothing wrong with them. Captains are expected to take standard reserves, allowances for winds and weather, plus about 100kg (see details next para). 
                                    - The strange thing about Ryanair’s relationship with its pilots is that it does not employ its Effos and some of its captains. It requires them to be self-employed, but exclusively contracted to Ryanair. Their employment contracts and human resources issues are dealt with by agencies like Brookfield, but Brookfield doesn’t employ them either. Ryanair’s interface with its pilots after selection is CrewDock, training, and Base Captains, so it’s only ops practices that are held in common.

Excluding fuel costs, the difference is even starker, with Easyjet’s cost per passenger 67% above that of Ryanair. This unit cost advantage against easyJet stems mainly from airport and handling charges. This, in turn, comes from Ryanair's use of smaller, lower cost airports with fast turnaround times, its bargaining power with airports and the impact of bag and check-in fees on lowering handling and check-in costs at airports."

Public perception of Ryanair is often that it is mean, uncaring and money-grabbing. As the airline matures and consolidates its position as Europe’s leading short haul carrier, this perception could start to have an adverse impact on sales (although this does not appear to be the case yet). Indeed, Mr O'Leary almost seems to make a virtue of this feature of the brand - as a distinctively recognisable low price airline."

                            - customer friendly objectives
                                - Initiatives announced by Ryanair and comments made by Mr O’Leary at the company’s AGM on 20-Sep-2013 indicate that it is considering changes to its distribution policy, improving its website, developing its digital marketing strategy, enhancing its image with respect to customer complaints and broadening its appeal to business travellers.
                            - Distribution policy - travel agents?
                              "Currently, Ryanair inventory is not available through the GDS (unlike easyJet) and travel agents have to book through Ryanair’s website, just like individual travellers."

                                -  Ryanair’s mobile app is now free to download from iTunes and Google Play Store. The app enables passengers to access fares, check timetables, make and review bookings and add optional services such as priority boarding and check-in bags. 
                                  "Previously, Ryanair charged EUR3 to download the app."
                                - Ryanair launched its official Twitter account on 23-Sep-2013. This will carry content including Ryanair news, route developments and special offers. Mr O’Leary recently said that Ryanair would make significant progress related to the interactivity of its Twitter account.

Management believes that people do not fly to destinations but fly at a price. By offering a price low enough, it will generate demand for a city or a country where there was previously no demand."

Ryanair’s recent figures have been disappointing. Yields are down, prices are lower and demand is soft. Shaky numbers that might have been attributed to weak sterling and the warm summer have continued into September."

                            - "Ancillary revenues grew by 25% to account for 27% of total revenues, their highest ever proportion. The strong growth in ancillaries reflected an improved product mix, the introduction of reserved seating across the network, higher admin/credit card fees and internet-related revenues"
                            - " Staff costs accounted for 11% of total costs in the quarter, a much lower proportion than for most airlines, for whom this is typically one of the top two expense categories."

                                - Fuel and oil 47%

                                  Often younger, non-unionised staff. Younger, in the airline business, means cheaper. 20 years as a purser on a 2% annual pay rise adds up.
                                  
                                  In fact Ryanair - and I think easyJet - employs a lot of their crew in lower-wage markets like eastern europe rather than the UK."
                                    - Hi, Mr Reepers, for a school assignment i am research Ryanair. It has come to my attention that you have made some interesting  remarks, and seem well informed on the company. Would it be possible to ?
                                - "I keep getting mixed reviews about the LCCs. But one reason I always shied away from Ryanair in particular (and I'm surprised the article doesn't mention this) is that - at least in their early days - they would fly to airports way outside the city limits, such that their passengers would still have lengthy taxi or train rides to get to their ultimate destinations. Economically of course, this made perfect sense, since landing and other fees at such airports would typically be much lower. But those savings would usually be Ryanair's, not the passenger's; whatever I'd save on an air fare, I might lose to a taxi driver, or I'd get to my ultimate destination much later than I would like."
                            - Regional Airports - ryanair's stakeholders as a competitive advantage?
                              "http://www.economist.com/news/business/21588076-proposed-eu-rules-aim-stem-flow-money-taxpayers-pockets-ryanairs-coffers?zid=303&ah=27090cf03414b8c5065d64ed0dad813d"
                                - "Local politicians’ enthusiastic sponsorship of airports, as a means to boost their regional economies, has in turn contributed to the rapid growth of low-cost airlines, since the airports have used their subsidies to offer cheap landing fees and other sweeteners to persuade the cheap carriers to fly there."
                                - "The full-service airlines, their businesses devastated by low-cost competition, have filed complaints against Ryanair and its benefactors."
                                - "The aim is to reconcile the principle of fair competition with the airports’ role in boosting small towns’ economies and keeping them connected to the outside world. State subsidies towards operating costs at airports handling over 200,000 passengers a year will be phased out over ten years, and charges to airlines must rise to compensate"
                                - "Mr O’Leary, in a rare show of assent with the Eurocrats, says the new rules are “terrific”. That may sound odd: their objective is to eliminate the state aid that flows to his airline. But Mr O’Leary is a realist, so he probably sees the new rules as the best he could hope for, given the pressure on the commission to ensure fairer competition."
                                - "But if its new rules achieve this objective, the result will be that some smaller airports will find it hard to pay Ryanair and other low-cost carriers enough to keep them flying there. Many of the 80-odd European airports with fewer than 1m passengers will be at risk of closing, like Angoulême; in other cases passengers will face higher ticket prices. And some of Europe’s less-famous spots will see fewer tourists."

                                    - "Contrary to what this article states, EU law bans State aid UNLESS it does not distort competition contrary to the common interest. Read article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
                        - Why customer friendly attitude?
                            - "Of course, these kinds of efforts are not solely the creation of a marketing team alarmed by unpleasant press—Ryanair has managed that for years—it’s mainly about bottom-line business. The airline has gotten to 80 million annual passengers and wants to boost that to 110 million by 2019. What worked to get this far, the airline has likely concluded, will not attract another 30 million customers on a continent where low-cost airlines have proliferated like rabbits."

                            - "22% of the low-cost carrier's passengers are corporate travellers"
                            - " Its business model minimises non-essential perks, maximises ancillary revenue, and involves flying to cheaper, secondary airports on the outskirts of its advertised destinations. "
                            - "Ryanair's only foray into premium service has been reserved seating"
                            - COMMENTS:
                                - "In recent recession years there's been a huge number of business travellers who are not "suits" but who are entrepreneurs (small business owners) or employees of smaller companies for whom travel budget savings are significant. That means booking one's own flights, hotels and other travel arrangements. There's no "corporate travel agency". Ryanair fits. It's not pleasant but it's a necessity."
                                - "Actually, probably a bigger reason why Ryanair doesn't have more business travellers is that they don't sell via travel agencies. Most big corporations still have their travel managed by Travel Management Companies which prefer not to book on an airline's website if they can avoid it because it takes time and is not integrated with their back-office billing and accounting systems."
                        - "The company earns most of its revenue in euro or sterling and has many of its expenses in dollars; however, it has hedged against currency fluctuations to minimize the risk it is exposed to"

                            - "due to deregulation of the air travel market by the European Union in 1997, Ryanair launched its first European routes and became a public company with a successful flotation on the Dublin and NASDAQ (New York) Stock Exchanges."
                            - ". LCC‟s are characterized as offering short-haul routes, operating a single-aircraft type, operating from secondary airports, high frequency flights, avoiding transfer traffic, outsourcing functions when possible, offering buy-on-board catering and selling tickets through call-centers and websites"
                            - Public Financing
                                - "Ryanair's policy is to serve airports only where authorities give them preferential treatment"
                                - " For example, in Belgium, the authorities have given Ryanair free office space and staff training (Noakes, 2003). As another example, Ryanair does not fly to Nice in France, because the authorities are not willing to give the airline better treatment than its competitors (Dobruszkes, 2006)."

                            - The Website
                                - "Ryanair's website also makes out a significant physical resource in terms of revenue generation as 99 % of all sales are generated through the website where the customer has direct access to Ryanair‟s host reservation system (Ryanair Holdings PLC, 2009).Consequently, Ryanair has eliminated the cost of commissions to travel agents. Also, the airline plans to make check-in available exclusively through the website (ibid), thus eliminating the costs of airport kiosks and staff. Consequently, the website is valuable as it improves the company‟s efficiency and effectiveness by taking advantage of the opportunities the internet offers."

                            - confrontation analysis
                              "confronting, copmaring, contrasting internal vs external findings"
                            - Other examples: Directional Policy Matrix & BCG Matrix
                        - The following concepts are ways to completely, coherently & succinctly put strategy into words:
                        - Generic Strategies
                          "only 3 positions to choose  that will protect you against the 5 forces"
                            - Cost Leadership
                                - produce at lowest cost
                                  "does not necessarily mean you sell at lowest price either "
                                - therefore strong focus on efficiency
                                - complete on a very limited set of attributes with minimum level of satisfaction
                                - how does CL protect from Porter's five forces?
                                    - rivalry: low cost leaves you with enough margin to engage in rivalry
                                      "best position to survive rivalry"
                                    - buyer power: even if buyers can 'shop around' they alwalys end up with you
                                    - supplier power:  even if suppliers threaten to raise powers this will affect the profitability of your competitors more than your profitability
                                    - threat of entrants: 
                                        - a likely reason for your cost leader position is because of scale economies , these scale econs act as a barrier to entry
                                        - ability to cut price might act as a detterent
                                    - threat of subs: determined by price/performance tradeoff..
                            - DIfferentiation
                                - be good at delivering a certrain product attribute that is valued by customers
                                - differentiation occurs on a list of attributes
                                  "tech, brand image, company rep, service, distribution channels, etc.."
                                - how you are differentiated should be explained in the 'value proposition'
                                - it does not allow firms to ignore price and costs, but these are not of primary strategic concern
                                - Protection
                                  "does not mean forces become low, just protected"
                                    - R: only happens if someone is competing on similar attributes
                                      "however you are NOT rivaling on price ( price r is most damaging to profitability)"
                                    - BP: if you can build brand loyalty customers will become less price sensitive
                                      "also differentiation might lead to customer switching costs; more dependent on you, might actually lower the force "
                                    - SP: differentiation always you to ask higher prices and therefore higher margins
                                      "higher margins hive you room to deal with powerful suppliers, not reducing but are protecting "
                                    - ToE: differentiated product might imply switching costs for your customers which acts as barrier to entry
                                    - ToS: diff products might imply switching costs for your customers which diminishes  threat of subs
                            - Focus
                                - addressing the needs of one particular group of buyers
                                - within focus either differentiation or cost leader
                                - you are not cost leader or differentiated for the whole inudstry

                                  When resting on their laurels signals trouble for businesses which lack flexibility to change; 
                                  In order to compete in more volatile and uncertain environments, businesses need to do things differently

                                  Finding a real competitive advantage in an industry has been likened to discovering the Holy Grail in the corporate strategy stakes. However, it's an increasingly elusive goal, according to US management expert, Prof Rita McGrath.
                                  McGrath, who is based at Columbia Business School but is a frequent visitor to these shores, says that organisations now need to find ways of leveraging temporary advantages and to remain fluid and innovative enough to change tack when those advantages no longer remain.
                                  Sony, Research In Motion (RIM) - the makers of BlackBerry - and Blockbuster video are examples of firms that have suffered for this very reason.
                                  "Their downfall is a predictable outcome of practices that are designed around the concept of sustainable competitive advantage.
                                  "The fundamental problem is that deeply ingrained structures and systems designed to extract maximum value from a competitive advantage become a liability when the environment requires instead the capacity to surf through waves of short-lived opportunities," she says.
                                  "To compete in these more volatile and uncertain environments, you need to do things differently."
                                  Stability, not change, she says, is the state that is most dangerous in highly dynamic competitive environments. The presumption of stability creates all the wrong reflexes.
                                  It allows for inertia and power to build up around the existing business model. It also allows people to fall into routines and habits of mind and it creates the conditions for turf wars.
                                  "Human beings like predictability and managers find comfort in knowing what the rules are but it fast moving markets, it just doesn't work anymore." she tells The Irish Times.
                                  However, two aspects of management which she says shouldn't change are the cultural values and strong leadership characteristics of organisations.
                                  The rapid change of the life cycle of advantages mirrors the shrinking in the time to mass adaptation of items such as popular consumer electronics.
                                  The telephone and television developed over a period that covered most of the 20th century yet the smartphone achieved mass adaptation in a period of less than five years. The internet has been a massive accelerator of this phenomenon across a whole range of categories of products and services, she agrees.
                                  One of the biggest changes in mind-set that is the need is to think of arenas rather than industries. The revolution in digital music is a case in point. Who could have predicted before the launch of iTunes that a computer company Apple would achieve such a pivotal position in the music business?
                                  Customer relationshipsThe arena concept also suggests that conventional ideas about what creates a long-lived advantage will change. Product features, new technologies, and the "better mousetrap" sources of advantage are proving to be less durable.
                                  Instead, companies are learning to leverage more ephemeral things such as deep customer relationships and the ability to design unique experiences across multiple arenas.
                                  In her latest book, The End of Competitive Advantage, McGrath distils the process by which a company creates a transient advantage. This starts with identifying an opportunity, allocating resources and assembling a team.
                                  If and when that opportunity gets traction, the firm must ramp up its advantage speedily. All going well, it can then enjoy a long period of exploitation where it can milk the profits. This period can be extended if the firm reconfigures its structure by changing management or shifting resources. Bigger pictureFinally, when the advantage is exhausted, there is a process of disengagement where a firm disposes of its assets by selling, shutting them down or re-purposing them.
                                  This should be done gracefully but quickly, she says, adding: "This should not be confused with business failure. Disengagement can and should take place when a business is still viable, rather than when a desperate organisation has no choice."
                                  McGrath can see a downside to transient competitive advantage and says she worries that it may compound existing inequalities. Those most capable of exploiting short-term advantages, by their nature, are the rich and the most powerful.
                                  "We see it in the fast food sector in the United States where analytics can tell you the precise hours and minutes you need workers in your restaurants to optimise your profits. You can't expect people to build a life around that," she observes.
                                  Good companies, she says, see the bigger picture. One of the companies she features in the book is Infosys, which hires for "learnability", as one of its bosses told her. Employees spent 80 per cent of their time on defined core work task but the reaming 20 per cent is allocated to training and research efforts, she notes.
                                  Transient advantage has implications for how employees - as well as companies - manage career development, she says and she devotes a chapter of the book to how individuals need to see their own futures differently (see panel).

                                  Warren Buffett loves moats.
                                  Not the watery variety, mind you. The billionaire has long admired companies with competitive advantages that act as barriers to potential rivals. He likes to say that these fortunate companies have an "economic moat."
                                  Investors have an obvious incentive to find and treasure such firms, but unfortunately Mr. Buffett is not in the business of pointing out the companies that have strong moats and those that don't. The Chicago-based research firm Morningstar is, however.
                                  Morningstar, which makes moat judgments a core part of its investment advice, has gone so far as to trademark the phrases "economic moat" and "moat trend." It assigns moat ratings to every one of the 1,600-plus companies it covers.
                                  "We were trying to find companies with strong, sustainable competitive advantages," says Morningstar's Heather Brilliant. "We really felt like the term 'economic moat' fit, and it was something that could be popularized and used to a greater extent. So we started putting more research and rigour into determining whether a company has a moat or not."
                                  On first blush, the notion might seem gimmicky. But a closer look at Morningstar's moat analysis can help investors better understand a key question they should consider when evaluating any stock: Just how strong is a company's competitive position? And is it getting better or worse?
                                  Broadly speaking, companies with wide economic moats have "the strongest possible competitive advantages," Matthew Coffina of Morningstar says. Companies with narrow economic moats also have strong competitive positions, he says, "but we don't expect their advantages to last as long as those of wide-moat companies."
                                  Morningstar says an economic moat can be based on any one of several factors. Some firms - like Google or Facebook - benefit from a network effect that increases the value of their services as they attract more customers.
                                  Other companies build their moats on intangible assets like patents and brands. (Pepsi-Cola, for instance.) Still others find their competitive edge in a cost advantage, or their efficient scale. And some (like IT giant Oracle) get an edge from pricing power because their customers face too many costs in switching to another company.
                                  How do you tell if a company has a moat? If a firm consistently produces returns on invested capital that are greater than its peers for several years, that's a good sign, Ms. Brilliant says.
                                  The harder question, she adds, is determining how sustainable the moat will be - then figuring out if it's available to investors at the right price. "Purely identifying companies with moats does not lead to excess returns," she says. "What leads to excess returns is buying them at a discount."
                                  Calgary pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. is the only one out of 57 Canadian companies rated by Morningstar that has both a wide moat and a positive "moat trend." A key part of its competitive edge is its scale: it has pipeline presences in the oil sands, the Bakken fields in the Midwest U.S., and in Cushing, Okla., as well as growth opportunities in natural gas and electricity.
                                  David McColl of Morningstar says Enbridge is just one of a handful of pipeline companies "with the expertise, scale, access to capital, and geographic reach to successfully grow its pipeline transportation business." He raised his fair-value estimate for Enbridge shares this week to $54 (U.S.), compared to recent prices around $45.
                                  Canada's big telecoms, Rogers Communications Inc.,BCE Inc. and Telus Inc., all have narrow moats, according to Morningstar's analysis. But they're still considered attractive investments, despite competition from smaller wireless companies. Analyst Imari Love says Canada "is one of [Morningstar's] favourite wireless markets, since it is dominated by three rational operators that value profit over market share."
                                  BCE and Rogers have stable moat trends, but Telus's trend is negative, according to Morningstar. "Rogers (along with Telus and Bell), might have trouble winning the near-term margin battle - but its scale advantages, network superiority, and handset lineup put it in the pole position to win the long-term war," Mr. Love says.
                                  Mr. Love gives Telus a negative moat trend because of the deals BCE and Rogers have struck to acquire content for their wireless networks, "a move that would push Telus further behind its peers."
                                  Mr. Love's fair value estimates are $60 for Rogers, $43 for BCE and $38 for Telus, giving Rogers "the best risk/reward dynamic in the sector."
                                  Canadian Tire Corp. and Magna International Inc. are among the Canadian companies Morningstar has deemed moatless.
                                  Canadian Tire "possesses the competitive advantages of convenience and high store-brand recognition," and has also implemented efficiency initiatives that will improve its position, the Morningstar retail analyst team says in a note.
                                  Still, the analysts say, "We expect the increased competition from larger U.S.-based retailers, which have greater scale advantages, will pressure profit margins and returns on capital over the next decade." Morningstar's fair value estimate is $73 (Canadian), about current price levels.
                                  While Morningstar finds Canadian Tire's moat trend "stable" for now, Magna's is negative, the firm believes. The auto-parts supplier has lower margins than other global companies in its sector, and its returns, says analyst Richard Hilgert, "have not been as impressive." His fair value estimate is $50 (U.S.), below recent levels.

                                  Mapping the moats
                                  Companies with wide economic moats possess competitive advantages that allow them to repel would-be rivals. Morningstar ranks not only the size of corporate moats but also the trend - whether the moats are growing or shrinking.

                                  "If you don't have a competitive advantage, don't compete." -- Jack Welch
                                  If you want to invest in stocks that could churn out a rising stream of income for years to come, author Frederick Martin of Disciplined Growth Investors suggests you look for companies with a sustainable competitive advantage.
                                  A competitive advantage can help boost a company's intrinsic value because it helps ensure the future growth of the company. Current growth rates alone are not enough to judge a company's long term growth potential, Martin explains in his book, "Benjamin Graham and the Power of Growth Stocks" (McGraw-Hill). "Focusing solely on the prospects for growth while ignoring the quality of the underlying business model can be a dangerous investment proposition."
                                  It's not just the growth itself that determines the value of the stock, but the type of growth that really matters. Without a competitive advantage, there's no assurance that current growth will lead to future profits. As Benjamin Graham wrote in "The Intelligent Investor," "Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors."
                                  In other words, not all growth is good growth. To prove his point, Graham referred to the airline industry of the 1940s and 1950s as a potent growth industry that routinely yielded disappointing returns for the airlines and their shareholders. In fact, airlines have continued to struggle despite rising demand for air travel. The industry lost nearly $40 billion between 1971 and 2009.
                                  Yet during that same period, one new competitor in the airline industry was able to generate $6.6 billion in PROFIT! Competing in the same industry with the same cost of goods, Southwest Airlines consistently made money while the airline giants teetered from one financial crisis to another. "We can boil down Southwest's superior financial results to one critical difference," writes Martin, "the strength of the business model. Southwest's business model was highly defensible; the others' were not."
                                  A DEFENSIBLE BUSINESS
                                  Martin considers a "defensible business model" to be "the defining characteristic that sets great growth companies apart from the pack."
                                  But what, exactly, is a defensible business model?
                                  It is the moat the company builds around itself to ward off competition and ensure continued viability by relying on any one of a number of sustainable competitive advantages.
                                  "From an investment perspective," explains Martin, "the key characteristic of a company with a defensible business model is that the model enables the company to increase its intrinsic value at a much faster rate than companies with weak business models."
                                  The more solid the sustainability of the business model, the greater the chances the company will continue to grow. Since intrinsic current value is based on future growth, companies with a defensible business model command a premium in the market.
                                  How do you identify companies with a defensible business model? The first step is to look for a sustainable competitive advantage.
                                  SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
                                  "At its most rudimentary level, a sustainable competitive advantage is a durable and unique set of capabilities and industry dynamics that give the company a superior chance of winning with customers," explains Martin.
                                  There are several types of competitive advantages, including competitive barriers, operational excellence, return on investment, and tidal waves of opportunity.
                                  Investors sometime confuse competitive advantage with competitive "strategy." Once you recognize the distinction between the two, it will be easier to identify companies with a true sustainable competitive advantage.
                                  "A sustainable competitive advantage is structural in nature," explains Martin. "It is not merely an endless series of tactical moves (such as price discounts or duplicable cost reductions) that allow a company to temporarily stay one step ahead of the competition, nor is it a unique long-term operating strategy. Sustainable competitive advantage is embedded in the underlying business model."
                                  "Competitive strategy," he continues, "is a choice. It speaks to how a company elects to compete in the marketplace. For instance, certain firms in an industry might strive to be the low-cost producer, while others may adopt a strategy geared toward offering premium products and services to a select group of clients. The permutations of competitive strategy are limitless; the expression of competitive advantage is not."
                                  A well-executed competitive strategy may enable a company to seize a competitive advantage where none existed before, but that possibility would be much harder to predict than simply identifying and investing in companies that already have a sustainable competitive advantage.
                                  Look at the leading companies across nearly every sector of the economy and you'll see that they all have a well-established competitive advantage that serves as a barrier to the competition.
                                  Competitive advantages typically take one of two forms, says Martin, "barriers" that keep potential customers out of the market, and "handcuffs" that keep their customers tied to their company.
                                  Here are several indicators of a competitive advantage to consider in identifying promising growth stocks:
                                   --  High and stable market share
                                   --  Steady market share gains
                                   --  Low frequency of exit or entrance of industry competitors
                                   --  Persistent pricing power
                                   --  Materially higher operating margins than direct competitors
                                   --  Loyal customers and low customer churn
                                   --  High repeat purchases
                                   --  Brand transferability to new categories
                                   --  Strong consumer routine or habit
                                   --  Long product cycles
                                   --  Robust domain expertise
                                   --  Proprietary manufacturing or business processes

                                    - Article Summary
                                      "The author  writes about a recently published book "The End of Competitive Advantage: How to Keep Your Strategy Moving as Fast as Your Business" by Rita G. McGrath, which resonates with his beliefs. The article rebukes the classical premise of strategy equaling the attainment of a 'sustainable competitive advantage', and replacing it with that of pursuing 'transient competitive advantages'. This is a shift from capitalizing on a specific long-term competitive advantage in a well-defined industry, to fostering innovation-based temporal competitive advantages. A new strategy of continually adapting to changes in volatile and uncertain markets with new competitive advantages. It follows by elaborating on the deprecation of the sustainable competitive advantage strategy in the present by saying competitive advantages in most markets are quickly copied and customers readily move on to alternatives. We have to move from thinking competition lies only within industry and realizing it can come from anywhere.  A concept of ‘an arena’ is introduced to explain this different spectrum of competitors and change in conventional strategies of creating a lasting competitive advantage. The future of strategy according to the article lies in "

                                        -  death of Professor Michael Porter’s concept of“sustainable competitive advantage”
                                          "it has been a dominating idea in the field of strategy since 1979"
                                        - Competitive advantage is transient, not sustainable
                                        - "the purpose of strategy is to achieve a sustainablecompetitive advantage"
                                        - Strategy was all about finding a favorable position in awell-defined industry and then exploiting a long-term competitiveadvantage. Innovation was about creating new businesses and was seen as something separate from the business’s core set of activities.
                                        - mentions a Creative economy
                                        - The fundamental problem is that deeply ingrained structures and systems designed to extract maximum value from a competitive advantage become a liability when the environment requires instead the capacity to surf through waves of short-lived opportunities. To compete in these more volatile and uncertain environments, you need to do thingsdifferently.
                                        - the purpose of strategy is to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage
                                        - two foundational assumptions that were taken as gospel. 
                                            - The first was that industry matters most.
                                            - The second assumption was that onceachieved, advantages are sustainable.
                                        - The book argues that sustainable competitive advantage still exist in customers relationship, highly specialized fields and basic necessities but the trend of sustainable competitive advantage is shifting in more and more sectors. This happens because "which advantages are copied quickly, technology changes, or customers seek other alternatives and things move on." 
                                        - it inhibits innovation and a design of a strategic next step
                                        - a shift in threat from direct competitors to anyone anywhere. introduces the idea of areas instead of industries to classify potential competitors; the arena concept

                                        -  The subject is a recently published book that should be an interesting read. The article challenges the status quo, specifally a famous concept, sustainable competitive advantage.  It also links to another article we found in the Irish Times (..).
                                        - News as our source of research. Forbes.com has been an authority on business news since 1917 and therefore constitutes to us as a reliable.

                                        - the book they are referring to seems like applied research targeted to current business leaders
                                          "This book serves as a new playbook for strategy, one based on updated assumptions about how the world works, and shows how some of the world’s most successful companies use this method to compete and win today."
                                        - it is taken from an authority figure reflecting upon another authority figure's work in the subject of CA and therefore adheres to everydayknowledge one would gain from popular media
                                          "“The book is well written, well argued, assumes knowledge on the part of the reader without sliding into either corporate speak or the long words of academia, and the argument hard to refute... More importantly, the solutions offered here are immediately actionable.” — Business Traveller (businesstraveller.com)

Additionally experiments and surveys provide quantitative results which could be used verify our qualitative results but do not provide us with the qualitative results, in the first place. A case study would be a good contender but it would limit us to a couple of cases whereas interviews would allows us to more easily get a broader view with less time effort.] ]"

                                - we do need data triangulation to prove that the managements practices the CEOs mentions in the interviews actually resulted in new competitive advantages by comparing data from their financial performance

                                - An example of a spurious relationship can be illuminated examining a city's ice cream sales. These sales are highest when the rate of drownings in city swimming pools is highest. To allege that ice cream sales cause drowning, or vice-versa, would be to imply a spurious relationship between the two. In reality, a heat wave may have caused both. The heat wave is an example of a hidden or unseen variable, also known as a confounding variable.

                          "Are African Americans really better at basketball than Caucasians? Are blonds really dumber than brunettes? Are women really worse at math than men? The short answer is yes. The longer answer is no. Let me explain by focusing on the stereotype that women can’t do math. At first glance, this stereotype seems to be true. For instance, men continue to outperform women on the math sections of the SAT and GRE, and men outnumber women in college math courses and math-related jobs. Surely this is evidence that women are not as good at math as men. But as this article will explain stereotypes are self-perpetuating and not only reflect but also cause performance differences between groups.
                          
                          For instance, if the stereotype that women are worse than men at math reflects true group differences, then women should always score worse than men on a math test, no matter how the test is presented. However, this is not the case. Spencer, Steele, and Quinn, (1999) found that when a math test was described as showing no previous gender differences in performance, women performed as well as men. When the test did not include this description, men outperformed women, implying that the stereotype itself causes stereotypic behavior. In fact, stereotypes reinforce stereotypical behavior by way of two psychological phenomena.
                          
                          The first phenomenon, which was briefly referred to by Regenberg (2007) on her article in In-Mind on the question whether blonds are really dumb, is called Stereotype Threat. Stereotype threat occurs when someone feels threatened by the possibility of confirming a negative stereotype about their group (Steele, 1997). Ironically, this concern leads to decreased performance, which in turn confirms the stereotype that the person was hoping to avoid. An example of stereotype threat is a when a woman, who considers herself good at math but is aware of the stereotype that women can’t do math, takes a difficult math test. When she encounters difficult questions and experiences frustration, she doesn’t want others to think she is struggling because she is a woman. She feels increased pressure to perform well, which actually works against her and makes her perform worse.
                          
                          The second phenomenon that reinforces stereotypic behavior is called Stereotype Lift . Walton and Cohen (2003) found that men’s scores were higher on math tests that were described as showing previous gender differences in performance compared to tests that were described as showing no previous gender differences. In other words, men experienced a boost in performance when gender stereotypes were relevant to the situation, compared to when they were irrelevant. Downward Social Comparison , a process whereby people elevate their self-esteem by comparing their group to a lower-status group, is thought to be the basis for this lift in performance (Wills , 1981). Men are able to boost their self-esteem and improve their math performance by comparing themselves to women, who are stereotypically believed to be worse at math than men. They may think to themselves, this test is difficult but at least I know I am better at math than women. However, when stereotypes are made irrelevant to the given test, men are no longer able to use this line of thinking to boost their self-esteem.
                          
                          Together, decreases in women’s scores caused by stereotype threat combined with increases in men’s scores caused by Stereotype Lift work together to exaggerate the performance differences found between men and women in math domains. These exaggerated performance differences confirm and perpetuate the stereotype that women can’t do math, and the cycle of stereotype threat and Stereotype Lift continues with even greater fervor. It is a vicious cycle: the stereotype causes gender differences in math performance; these differences in performance confirm the stereotype; the stereotype grows stronger and is even more likely to produce exaggerated group differences. As a result of the seemingly inevitability of male superiority in math domains, fewer women enter math-related jobs and college courses because they view their efforts as futile. They may think to themselves, what’s the use of pursuing a career in math if I’m not genetically wired to do math and will always be outperformed by my male colleagues? Instead, they may seek self-worth from success in areas in which women are not negatively stereotyped. The small number of women in math-related fields further confirms and perpetuates the stereotype. It seems to be a never-ending cycle, but the negative effects of stereotypes are not inevitable. First, certain factors must be present for stereotype threat to occur, and second, the negative effects of stereotype threat can be prevented."
                        - Questions
                            - (1) What are stereotypes? Are they useful or useless?
                              "book definition: a generalization about a group of people in which identical characteristics are assigned to virtually all members of the group, regardless of actual variation among the members"
                                - a preconceived notion ( both positive and negative)  a person has about an individual based her membership of a group without taking into consideration individuality 
                                - they are useless because they generally lead to negative consequences based on unaccurate information processing? they might be useful in big data analysis?
                            - (2) Are we able to correct our stereotypes?
                                - We are able to make people more aware of it. 
                                  "depending on the level of belief the person has of it"
                                - we are able to affect the level by implementing contact theory

                            - (3) Summarize how and why stereotypes can influence our individual performance.
                        - stereotype
                          "a generalization about a group of people in which certain traits are assigned to virtually all members of the group, regardless of actual variation among  group members."
                            - denote both the positive and negative traits that people assign to group members
                            - cognitive process component
                            -  simplified “pictures” to cope with complexity of reality (few information -> virtual characterization and labeling for group) 
                            -  fundamental & universal bias in perception, already learned in childhood -> quite persistent, hard to change (social, political & environmental changes might change stereotypes) 
                            - stereotypes are fairly stable
                            -  enhanced by social, political and economical competition & tension between groups
                            - ---

                                - too young to appreciate diversity
                            - why?
                                - need for status, self-esteem and belonging
                                - the authoritarian personality (individual follows dictates of a strong leader and/or traditional, conventional values)

                            - an individual’s prejudicial attitudes & discriminatory behavior toward people of a given race/sex
                            - institutional practices that subordinate people of a given race/sex
                              "institutional: attitudes held by the vast majority of people in a society, stereotypes and prejudices are the norm"
                            - hostile sexism: women = inferior than men, negative view
                            - benevolent sexism: women = weaker sex, positive view, but limiting
                        - Normative Rules
                            - Through both explicit and implicit socialization, we are trained in the norms of our culture. Stereotypes and prejudiced attitudes are part of this normative package.

                            - normative conformity
                              "people want to be accepted in society, either not challenge/ go with stereotypes or hide them, because of normative conformity, thus, personal stereotypes can be influenced and changed to adapt!"
                                - Normative conformity: The tendency to go along with the group in order to fulfil the group’s expectations and gain acceptance.
                            - modern racism
                              "outwardly acting unprejudiced while maintaining prejudical attitudes in secret, avoid being labeled as racist (normative conformity!)"

                            -  stereotypes exist in most of us and are easily activated to have negative effects on the perception and treatment of out-group members.
                              "the findings by Greenberg and Pyszczynski (1985) Henderson-King and Nisbett (1996) suggests"
                            - 2-step model of cognitive processing
                              "by patricia devine"
                                - 1st: Automatic processing of information (= effortless)
                                  "brings up information/activates certain stereotypes which pop into one’s mind"
                                - We automate when: pressed for time, preoccupied, tired, emotionally aroused, overwhelmed, distracted
                                - 2nd: Controlled processing of information (= effortful)
                                  "can be used to consciously suppress, refute or ignore the stereotype"
                                - An individual can also maintain the information/stereotype derived from automatic processing of information & response accordingly! Step 2 is possible but not a must. 
                            - Justification-Suppression Model of Prejudice 
                              "of Crandall and Eshleman"
                                - people struggle between the prejudices the urge to express prejudice and their need to maintain a positive self-concept
                                - individual looks out for information that justifies holding negative attitude toward a certain group
                                  "doesn't always put effort in consciously suppressing stereotypes"
                            - Illusory Correlation 
                                -  is the tendency to see relationships, or correlations, between events that are actually unrelated. 
                                - most likely to occur when the events or people are distinctive or conspicuous; minority group members are so by definition
                                - Once formed, an illusory correlation increases attention to confirming information and decreases attention to disconfirming information.
                                - Illusory correlation: when we expect two things to be related, we fool ourselves into believing that they are, even when they are actually unrelated. 
                            - Confirmation bias
                              "avoiding cognitive dissonance"
                                - Instead of suppressing prejudices, We’re always on the look out to information that will enable us to convince our selves that there is a valid justification for holding a negative attitude toward a particular out-group.
                            - You cannot change stereotypical beliefs simply by providing accurate information. Disconfirming evidence can actually strengthen stereotypical belief because people then came up with additional reasons for holding their belief.  
                              "Kunda and Olsen (1997) found"
                        - Effects of Social Categorization & Prejudice
                            - The first step in prejudice is the creation of group categorizations. Once we have mental categories, we group stimuli into them by similarities, downplaying differences between members of a group and exaggerating differences between members of different groups.
                            - in-group bias
                              "especially positive feelings and special treatment reserved for people of the in-group"
                                - us vs. them (we amplify differences between us and others), favor our own group over another group, positive feelings for own group/ treat others unfairly, if own group considered superior, membership in groups 
                                - Tajfel postulates that the underlying motive is self-esteem maintenance & enhancement

                                    - Minimal Group Paradigm: 
                                        - people randomly assigned to groups (membership based on trivial criteria; no common history, norms or values), group members have no contact during experiment
                                        - Results: in-group favoritism, rate members of own group higher
                                        - BUT: does not work with punishment (e.g. taking points away)
                            - out-group homogenity
                              "perception that individuals in the Out-Group are more similar to each other than they really are, we do see diversity in our own group (In-group seems more heterogeneous than Out-group)"
                            - What are 2 reasons it is hard to get someone deep-seated prejudice to change his mind?
                                - 1 emotional aspect of attitudes
                                  "logic is not effective in countering emotions; people will ignore or distort any challenges to their belief"
                                - 2 firmly established schema for target group(s)
                                  "pay attention to and recall more often, information that is consistent with their beliefs than that which is inconsistent"
                                - stereotypes are thus relatively impervious to change
                        - Attributional Biases
                            - stereotypes are negative dispositional attributions
                            - ultimate attribution error
                              "• by Thomas Pettigrew called this making dispositional attributions about a whole group of people "
                                -  when you make an ultimate attribution error, you make a dispositional attributions(based on our stereotypical belief) about an entire group of people. 
                                - A dispositional attributions is when you conclude that a person's behavior is due to some aspect of his or hers personality, rather than some aspect of the situation.
                                - when member of our group behaves differently, we attribute that to the situation (not to character) maintain our stereotypes

                            - expectations and distortions
                                - out-group members behave in way that we expect them to behave  which confirm and strengthen our prejudice, when they do not behave according to our expectations we blame situational attribution, but belief that normally, stereotype is true
                            - blaming the victim
                              "Furnham & Gunter, 1984"
                                - tendency to blame individuals for their victimization (desire to see the world as a fair place, everyone gets what he/she deserves), “well-deserved reputation” to justify victimization
                                - Blaming the victim: the tendency to blame individuals (make dispositional attributions) for their victimization, typically motivated by a desire to see the world as a fair place. (people deserve what they got)
                            - self-fulfilling prophecy
                                - The self-fulfilling prophecy is a case whereby people (1) have an expectation about what another person is like, which (2) influences how they act toward that person, which (3) causes that person to behave in a way consistent with people’s original expectations. 
                                - it is a process in which we find confirmation and proof for our stereotypes by unknowingly creating stereotypical behavior in out-group members through our treatment of them.
                                - individual has expectations about other person, which then influence behavior toward person so that this person actually behaves in the way consistent with the individual’s expectations
                            - Realistic conflict theory
                                - is the theory that limited resources lead to conflict between groups and result in increased prejudice and discrimination.
                                - Competition for resources leads to derogation of and discrimination against the competing out-group.
                            - scapegoating
                              "aggressions of frustrated people are dicplaced from real source toward a convenient target: visible, disliked, powerless out-group, often because of competition with group"
                                - is the tendency for individuals, when frustrated or unhappy, to displace aggression onto groups that are disliked, visible, and relatively powerless
                                - may occur when people are frustrated (for example, by scarcity of resources) but there is no clear target to blame the frustration on. It may occur even in the absence of direct competition.
                            - glass ceiling
                              "situations where the advancement of a qualified person within the hierarchy of an organization is stopped at a lower level because of some form of discrimination (e.g. sexism or racism)"
                            - glass cliff

                            - Stereotype Threat
                              "as the apprehension experienced by members of a minority group that they might behave in a manner than confirms an existing cultural stereotype"
                                - the worry caused by SThreat interferes with their ability to perform well
                                -  feel threatened by possibility to confirm negative stereotype, be under pressure to perform well, concern about poor performance leads to decreased performance (confirms stereotype)
                                - The Stereotype threat refers to the fact that people perform poorly when they are afraid to confirm their own stereotype.
                                - requirements:
                                    - negative stereotype for testing domain must exist

                            - Imagining Contact -article
                              "The contact hypothesis states that, under the right conditions, contact between members of different groups leads to more positive intergroup relations. The authors track recent trends in contact theory to the emergence of extended, or indirect, forms of contact. These advances lead to an intriguing proposition: that simply imagining intergroup interactions can produce more positive perceptions of outgroups. The authors discuss empirical research supporting the imagined contact proposition and ﬁnd it to be an approach that is at once deceptively simple and remarkably effective. Encouraging people to mentally simulate a positive intergroup encounter leads to improved outgroup attitudes and reduced stereotyping. It curtails intergroup anxiety and extends the attribution of perceivers’ positive traits to others. The authors describe the advantages and disadvantages of imagined contact compared to conventional strategies, outline an agenda for future research,  and discuss applications for policymakers and educators in
                              their efforts to encourage more positive intergroup relations."
                                - Reducing prejudice through simulated contact: Imagined contact could be highly effective as a first step on the route toward reconciliation and reduced prejudice.
                                - Contact hypothesis
                                  "contact between members of opposing groups, under right conditions, would lessen intergroup hostility and lead to more positive intergroup attitudes."
                                - direct/actual contact
                                    - come in contact with a person/group you hold a prejudice against, that prejudice will be reduced, because trough that contact you learn that you are wrong
                                - extended c
                                    - holds that knowing that a member of one's own group has a close relationship with a member of an outgroup can lead to more positive attitudes towards that outgroup
                                    - When a person’s ingroup friends have outgroup friends, prejudice about outgroups is reduced.  So actual experience of contact with outgroups is not the only way that contact benefits for intergroup relations.     
                                - imagined c
                                    - proposes that simply imagining a positive encounter with a member or members of an outgroup category can promote more positive intergroup attitudes.
                                    - Imagined intergroup contact is the mental simulation of a social interaction with a member or members of an out group category. Imagination of intergroup contact engages in conscious processes that parallel the processes involved in actual intergroup contact. When people imagine a positive interaction with an out group member they subsequently expressed more positive attitudes and stereotyped less than people who did not.
                                    -  can reduce your prejudice by imagining the contact. this means that even if there is no actual contact between you and the prejudiced, if you imagine a positive interaction with them, this will change your view
                                - share a common goal and depend on each other to achieve this goal, maybe also by the empathy
                                - Bystander apathy effect:
                                  " the idea that people are less likely to help others if other people are present. "
                                - Intergroup anxiety
                                    - the negative emotional reaction that can occur at the prospect of having to engage in an intergroup (between ingroup and outgroup) encounter. Most likely to arise when there has been minimal previous contact.  If people imagine the encounter first, there will be less intergroup anxiety    
                        - accentuation effect
                            - It is the tendency to overestimate similarities between people within a category and dissimilarities between people from different categories
                            -  refers to 'adding up' an outlying difference to a central difference and thereby increasing intragroup similarities (so the group is more alike) and intergroup differences (more differences between groups)
                            - Peripheral dimension influences focal dimension 
                            - Continuous distributed variable (i.e., height) is accentuated by the classification of a peripheral variable (i.e., group membership)
                            - leads to exaggeration of intergroup similarities and intragroup differences
                        - social identity theory
                          "http://www.utwente.nl/cw/theorieenoverzicht/Theory%20clusters/Interpersonal%20Communication%20and%20Relations/Social_Identity_Theory.doc/"
                            - social identity theory basically states that there is not one "you", but that "you" consist of multiple personalities that are defined by the social group you are in. For example you might naturally be a very timid person, but when you are at your footbal club you act very outgoing, because you believe that behaviour fits your social group. In a nutshell it says you base your behaviour on what you define your group as. 
                            - self-categorization theory, an individual has multiple “social identities” (= self-concept derived from perceived membership of social groups) 
                            - group membership -> in-group bias, self-categorization and self-stereotyping: individuals take on the norms, values, behavior of their group, also: positively differentiating/ comparison of in- group with outgroup, identification with a group as motive for positive self-perception & self-esteem 
                              "also lowered self- esteem among certain groups, own belief that they are inferior"

                                - Natural tendency when faultlines occur is to use relationship orientation. But this will only increase faultlines, because differences become more apparent when socializing.

                              background, and functional background"

                                    - differences in readily detectable attributes such as sex, age, and ethnicity
                                    - visible, easily detectable differences (e.g. demographic diversity)
                                - informational/value div
                                    - work experience, educational background
                                    - “functional diversity”, underlying, less visible attributes (e.g. educational background, skills, work experience), more job- related
                        - So Cat Perspective
                            - similarities and differences are used as a basis for categorizations. This may produce subgroups within the work group     
                            - The more homogeneous the work group, the higher member commitment and group cohesion will be, the fewer relational conflicts will occur    
                            - relational conflict
                              "where individuals disagree about one another, instead of the more beneficial content conlfict"
                        - Info/DM Perspective
                            - it holds that diverse groups should outperform homogeneous groups.  They have a broader range of knowledge and skills.  There’s less fast consensus, so more considered decision. Categorizations are more likely to be used when category markers are easily detectable, that people have been socialized into. Positive effects of diversity are linked to differences in informational differences.
                            - Focus on task-related aspects: pool of task-relevant information, abilities, knowledge & perspectives grows, thus diversity increases problem-solving, decision quality, creativity & innovation (certain degree of disagreement within group leads to thorough discussion) 
                            - diversity generally increases performance, should be fostered & promoted! 
                            - Reasons for promoting diversity:
                                - better utilization of talent
                                - better understanding marketplace
                                - more creativity and problem sovling
                        - Categorization-Elaboration Model
                            - renewed & refined look at both information/decision-making and social categorization process; the model points out inconsistency in the various findings about relationship between work-group diversity and performance 
                            - Building on information/decision making perspective, the CEM proposes diversity within a group is positively related to the elaboration of task-relevant information and perspectives. Which is positively related to group performance. But there are moderating factors    
                            - The salience of Social Categorization 
                              "The higher these components, the more likely a categorization is expressed. "
                                - Comparative fit
                                    - to what extent can groups be formed within a diverse group, so how many diversities are there to build up groups from?
                                    - The extent to which there is similarity within the in-group (intragroup similarity) and differences between the in and out groups (intergroup differences). 
                                    - , if the In group is very similar, and the in and out groups differ very much ( this would be referred to as a high comparative fit), it is more logical that social categorization takes place, because you can place yourself in a group and you can easily display the others as a different group
                                    - extent to which the categorization yields subgroups with high intragroup similarity and high intergroup differences.
                                - Normative fit
                                    - the extent to which the categorization makes sense in relation to the individual’s frame of reference
                                    -  The more logical a categorisation is to you, the more obvious it is that you will categorise it that way. If you have always been stereotypical about asian people, it is very likely that you will categorise a group as asians and non asians. 
                                    - Hence, the level of uniformity between your social norms and values ( A.K.A frame of reference) and the way the group is categorised determines the salience of social categorisation.
                                - Cognitive accesibillity
                                    - the ease with which the categorization comes to mind and the readiness of the perceiver to use the categorization
                                    - refers to the ease ( amount of energy nessecary) your brain has with categorising in a certain way. 
                                      "the ease with which the categorization comes to mind and the readiness of the perceiver to use the categorization"
                                    - Well-learned social categorizations are more accessible and come to mind easily    
                                - Relevance
                                    - Social categorization processes may disrupt elaboration of task-relevant information.    
                                    - Social categorization can be disruptive to diverse groups, IF there exists an intergroup bias.     
                                    - Intergroup bias is driven by threats and challenges to subgroup identity    
                                    - identity threat
                                      "occurs when a person thinks that their positive image might be damaged by the out-group"
                                    - Potentially negative effects of diversity identified in the social categorization perspective are linked to intergroup bias and not to social categorization per se    
                                    - Individuals value a positive and distinctive self-image, so group members value a positive and distinctive group identity. As a result intergroup biases are inspired by threats or challenges to the value or the distinctiveness of group identity. 
                                    - Intergroup biases elicited by work-group diversity are disruptive to elaboration of task-relevant information and therefore to group performance. Because when there exists an intergroup bias within a diverse work group, there is less communication between members of the in group and out group. 
                                - Social categorization is less likely when people differ on more than one dimension    
                                - jessie
                                    - It is argued that all these three factors are nessecary for social categorisation to be salient, and the salience is determined by how low or how high these factors are.
                                    - it is however also stressed that social categorisation itself might not be the wrongdoing factor that makes diverse teams fail, and/or perform poorly, but rather the intergroup bias that can result from categorisation. Hence, it is possible that social catgeorisation causes issues, but its also very possible that it does not. it depends on the situation, and to an extent, the levels of these aforementioned factors
                                    - Social categorization will only lead to bad performance if an identity threat occurs and consequently causes Intergroup Bias.
                                    - according to the categorization-elaboration model, the effects of Social Cat(identity threat and accompanying intra group bias and in-group bias) can be reduced IF the groups can adept to certain "rules" (cooperation and task interedependece, time time/tenure, and a diversity mindset) These can reduce the identity threat and we can use elaboration so diversity is a postive thing!
                            - Diversity may provoke both information/decision-making and social categorization, the two processes interact. 
                            - Elaboration
                                - the exchange of information and perspectives, individual-level processing of the information and perspectives, the process of feeding back the results of this individual-level processing into the group, and discussion and integration of its implications    
                                - it is the primary process underlying the positive effects of diversity on performance.    
                            - Diverse groups may have larger expertise and task-relevant information than homogenous groups.
                            - Differences in information and viewpoints may give rise to task conflict and dissent, which will engage the members in more elaborate processing of task-relevant information and search for more creative problem solutions. 
                                - BUT, there’s proof of a negative relation between task conflict and group performance. It’s not so much the absence or presence of conflict but it’s the way this is managed. It’s not the conflict that benefits, it’s the process to solve the conflict. 
                            - Task Level as Moderating Var
                                - Task requirements moderate the relationship between diversity and performance such that diversity may be positively related to performance when performance requires information processing and creative, innovative solutions. 
                                - Diverse groups outperform homogenous groups on difficult tasks, homogenous groups outperform diverse groups on more simple tasks. 
                            - Diversity is more likely to engender elaboration and to benefit performance when     
                                - member task motivation is high    
                                - member task ability is high

                                - no time constraints
                            - ????
                                - Either : comparative fit is high, perspectives are alright -> task motivation, requirements, ability lead to elaboration in a (diverse) work-group  ????????
                                - Or: Social categorization happens (due to lack of comparative fit + high cognitive accessibility of categorization and normative fit)  ????????????
                                    - maybe identity threat 
                                    - EITHER commitment, cohesion and identification (+ task motivation etc.: would lead to elaboration process & high performance) 
                                    - OR relational conflict, poor performance 
                                    - conflicts + task motivation& Co? -> elaboration & high performance possible 
                            - 8 propositions
                              "impact on performance"
                                - Proposition 1: The main process behind the positive effects of diversity on group performance is the elaboration of information that is relevant to the task.
                                    -  elaboration (discussion) of task-relevant information within team + diversity = positive impact on performance 
                                - Proposition 2: Task requirements moderate the relationship between diversity and performance. 
                                    - Diversity is positively related to performance when performance requires information processing and CREATIVE and INNOVATIVE solutions.
                                    - complex task requirements (e.g. creative and innovative solutions) + diversity = positive impact on performance 
                                    - Task motivation and ability are core moderators of the positive effects of diversity.
                                - Proposition 3 & 4: Diversity is more likely to engender elaboration and benefit performance when group members’ task ability and motivation are high (often linked to intelligence and education).
                                    - Proposition 3: high task motivation among group members + diversity = elaboration and thus positive impact on performance 
                                    - Proposition 4: high task ability among group members + diversity = elaboration and thus positive impact on performance 
                                - Proposition 5: social categorization depends on the 3 factors of self-categorization theory; comparative fit, normative fit & cognitive accessibility of an individual’s social categorizations 
                                - Proposition 6: When identity implied in categorization is subjectively threatened or biased, social categorization leads to intergroup bias.
                                    -  social categorization elicited by diversity 
                                - Proposition 7: Intergroup biases evoked by diversity are disruptive to elaboration of group performance.
                                - Proposition 8: all dimensions of diversity may elicit social categorization processes as well as elaboration processes within a diverse work-group = either positive or negative impact on performance

                                - Uzma Y uses a lot of weird facial expressions
                                - Francesca suggest selling at a food festival but is quickly put down a 'no no no' sentence by Rebecca who then follows with a clear, soft ( expert tone) over bringing of her reasoning for another beer festival
                                  "especially with " we are going to do is ..." already made the decision"
                                - Uzma outrightly rejects the beer festival idea(without a vague reason of thats not our target market), but PM just replies with 'okay' and then still chooses based on his the Rebecca's picking 
                                - choosing on the taste of the beer they all clap and scream 'yaay' - pretty jolly 
                                - Luissa says "sorry i dont mean to interupt" clashing with Uzma doesnt believe it and just rebukes her comment and keeps doing what she's doing ignoring Luissa
                                  "Luissa' face is one of incredulity, and her feedback is harshly brought over; "
                                - Luissa facial expression seems like she gonna vomit 
                                - does that make sense? Franchesca asks in the brewery , nobody seem really wanting to help or verify, not even the PM except for Rebecca but she simply confirms and doesnt double check but tries to ease her down a bit but sneaks in a command to " right it down" - Rebecca is trying to stay levelheaded... after they already mixed it Natalie says it completely wrongs not offering help as she seems to know what do do, even though they have assigned tasks they are rigid in no thelping
                                - at the morning meetup the first day franchesca gives the review of the previous day in the factory instead of Tim , no real PM?
                                - Luissa " im happy to go wherever you want me to go" 
                                - decison making was " we go with that, yeah ,yeah ok lets go with that"
                                - when TIM as PM needs to allocate the team he is indecisive  moving people about a lot

                                    - he starts making decisions instead of consulting and then jus tends up rearranging to whatever the team members decide
                                    - he forgot to about 'subteamleader' - " uhm i was thinking, um i was thinking to give it to ..." indecisive again
                                      "which he was questioned by  Luissa "

                                - meanwhile Rebecca was pitching, Uzma wanted to cut her off and she silenced her haha 
                                - uzma ask " dont ask them where this place is"  they are all blunt , hah abeing 'proactive', 'haha cat fight in the making?

                      "Dear Dijon,
                      
                      in the first survey, we asked you to answer several scales about your
                      personality. In the following, you will receive information about your
                      own perception of your personality. Please note that this information is
                      treated confidentially. Furthermore, there is no good or bad
                      personality. It is rather important to reflect upon yourself. This might
                      help you to find the right job (i.e., person-job fit) at the right
                      company (i.e., person-organization fit). It might be also very helpful
                      to understand the different "characters" in your team for your group
                      observation exercise. Humans differ and it is important to accept this
                      fact. Reflecting on personality concepts in general and your own in
                      particular should be a first important step to know who you are and why
                      sometimes "others" behave similar or different within a team or in the
                      daily interactions.
                      
                      We will give you feedback on the Big 5 personality traits, on your level
                      of need for closure, on your goal orientation, and on your need to
                      belong. We shortly explain how these constructs are defined - what they
                      are about. Subsequently, we will inform you about the average score of
                      all IBA students. In this way, you can compare how you are doing in
                      comparison to your peers in the classroom. Finally, your personal scores
                      will be presented.
                      
                      
                      (1)     The Big Five Model
                      
                      An impressive body of research supports that five basic dimensions
                      underlie all other personality dimensions. The five basic dimensions
                      are:
                      
                      Extraversion. Comfort level with relationships. Extroverts tend to be
                      gregarious, assertive, and sociable. Introverts tend to be reserved,
                      timid, and quiet.
                      
                      Agreeableness. Individual´s propensity to defer to others. High
                      agreeableness people-cooperative, warm, and trusting. Low agreeableness
                      people-cold, disagreeable, and raise their voice.
                      
                      Conscientiousness. A measure of reliability. A high conscientious person
                      is responsible, organized, dependable, and persistent. Those who score
                      low on this dimension are spontaneous, more chaotic, and easy-going.
                      
                      Emotional stability (or the reversed named Neuroticism). A person´s
                      ability to withstand stress. People with positive emotional stability
                      tend to be calm, self-confident, and secure. Those with high negative
                      scores tend to be nervous, sensitive, more empathetic, and emotional.
                      
                      Openness to experience. The range of interests and fascination with
                      novelty. Extremely open people are creative, curious, and artistically
                      sensitive. Those at the other end of the openness category are
                      conventional and find comfort in the familiar.
                      
                      These dimensions of our personality are neither negative nor positive in
                      general. But they can be helpful in certain situations. In other words,
                      sometimes high extraversion might be good, but in other contexts it
                      might be actually rather negative. Thus the scores you receive do not
                      indicate whether you have a good or bad personality. Rather, these
                      scores inform you how you see yourself on these dimensions and what your
                      personality might be. It might help you to find a job and an
                      organization that fits to your personality.
                      
                      Below, we will provide you the mean scores of the course (i.e., all
                      students of the IBA class). This helps to estimate in how your personal
                      values are in relation to your peers (i.e., judgments are not made in
                      relation to the mean of the scale).
                      
                      
                      The Big Five Results
                      
                      The means of your peers are:
                      Extraversion: 4.58
                      Openness to experience: 4.69
                      Agreeableness: 4.68
                      Conscientiousness: 4.58
                      Neuroticism (the opposite of emotional stability): 2.67
                      
                      Your personal scores are:
                      Extraversion: 5
                      Openess to experience: 5.4
                      Agreeableness: 5.3
                      Conscientousness: 4.9
                      Neuroticism (the opposite of emotional stability): 2.8
                      
                      
                      (2)     Need for cognitive closure
                      
                      An individual´s need for definite, unambiguous knowledge on an issue.
                      People high in need for closure dislike being in a state of uncertainty
                      and prefer to reach a conclusion or make a decision quickly and then
                      stick to it. People low in need for closure tend to gather more
                      information before they decide on a matter and are more likely to change
                      their minds on it if they learn something new.
                      
                      The mean score of all students on need for cognitive closure is: 3.43
                      
                      Your personal score on need for cognitive closure is: 2.2
                      
                      
                      (3)     Goal orientation
                      
                      Goal orientation is a "disposition toward developing or demonstrating
                      ability in achievement situations" (VandeWalle, 1997). These goal
                      orientations predict performance, goal setting, learning and leadership.
                      Similar to the BIG 5, there is no good and bad. Rather, it depends on
                      the circumstance what goal orientation is rather good or bad.
                      
                      Basically, there are two different goal orientations. Learning goal
                      orientation means in how far a person is "Focused on mastering" new
                      skills and knowledge. Thus, the more a person is learning oriented, the
                      more the person wants to learn new skills and knowledge. In contrast,
                      performance orientation is directed at performing tasks to achieve
                      approval from peers (e.g., other students, friends) or teachers.
                      Recently, these two goal orientations have been further differentiated
                      in so called approach and avoidance focus. Thus, there is a learning
                      approach and learning avoidance goal orientation as well as a
                      performance approach and performance avoidance goal orientation.
                      
                      Learning-approach goal orientation "entail striving to develop one's
                      skills and abilities, advance one's learning, understand material, or
                      complete or master a task" (Elliott, 1999, p. 181). On the other hand,
                      learning-avoidance goal orientation "entail striving to avoid losing
                      one's skills and abilities (or having their development stagnate),
                      forgetting what one has learned, misunderstanding material, or leaving a
                      task incomplete or unmastered" (Elliott,1999, p. 181).
                      
                      Performance approach goal orientation is the "desire to prove one's
                      competence and to gain favorable judgments about it" (VandeWalle, 1997,
                      p.1000). Alternatively, performance avoidance goal orientation is the
                      "desire to avoid the disproving of one's competence and to avoid
                      negative judgments about it" (VandeWalle, 1997, p.1000).
                      
                      One important issue is that learning avoidance goal orientation has
                      hardly been studied. Therefore, not much is known about its effects and
                      whether it is a useful concept. However, the other types of goal
                      orientation have been extensively researched. For an overview, you
                      should read Payne, Toungcourt, & Beaubien, 2007). It seems that
                      avoidance performance goals are the only ones that might potentially
                      relate to some negative outcomes. Learning goal orientation is generally
                      positive for self-efficacy, monitoring of learning progress, planning
                      and goal setting. Further, high learning goal orientation seems to be
                      better for academic performance than high performance goal orientation.
                      In case you feel that your score is low on learning (approach) goal
                      orientation, you can practice it by engaging in the material offered on
                      blackboard or in the course more consciously. Thus, it is possible to
                      change it.

                      An individuals need to belong indicates our intrinsic motivation to
                      affiliate with other individuals and to strive for social acceptance. It
                      is part of Maslow´s need hierarchy (i.e., will be discussed in the
                      motivation lecture) and predicts partly how portray ourselves towards
                      others. People high in need to belong strive more for long-term and
                      stable relationships. Further, these individuals are more likely to join
                      social activities that imply social affiliations (i.e., team sport).
                      People low in need to belong need less affiliation and can, therefore,
                      act more on their own independent of other people. Thus, if you have a
                      high score here, you should join some more of the social activities the
                      university offers (e.g., sport teams, student societies, etc).

                    - Dimensions of Culture
                      "Dear Dijon,
                      
                      Researchers have developed various dimensions to differentiate
                      personalities of humans. Similarly, research has produced a significant
                      amount of dimensions to differentiate groups based on their culture.
                      While groups can be teams within organizations, most often we use the
                      word "culture" in relation to national or ethnic groups. The OB book
                      offers you a couple of theories that differentiate dimensions of
                      culture. With the second survey, we also measured dimensions of culture.
                      However, we extend it to some state-of-the-art dimensions used to
                      differentiate culture. Again, there is no good and bad about these
                      dimensions. Rather, they help you to accept and understand why people
                      from different cultures might behave, feel and perceive differently than
                      yourself. We will give you feedback of the average class score, the
                      average score of the 4 largest nationalities in the classroom (Dutch,
                      French, German, Chinese) and your own score. With this, you might be
                      better able to understand potential differences in behavior within your
                      teams or classroom.
                      
                      (1)     Horizontal and vertical dimensions of individualism and collectivism
                      
                      First, we measured horizontal as well as vertical collectivism and
                      individualism (Singelis, Traindis, Bhawuk, Gelfand, 1995).
                      
                      "Horizontal collectivism (H-C) is a cultural pattern in which the
                      individual sees the self as an aspect of an in-group. That is, the self
                      is merged with the members of the in-group, all of whom are extremely
                      similar to each other. In this pattern, the self is interdependent and
                      the same as the self of others. Equality is the essence of this
                      pattern." (p.244)
                      
                      "Vertical collectivism (V-C) is a cultural pattern in which the
                      individual sees the self as an aspect of an in-group, but the members of
                      the in-group are different from each other, some having more status than
                      others. The self is interdependent and different from the self of

                      (2)     Tight and loose cultures
                      
                      Gelfland and colleagues (2011) differentiate between tight and loose
                      cultures. Namely, a "cultural variation that is dominating the
                      geo-political landscape and has the potential to be a major source of
                      cultural conflict: the difference between nations that are "tight"-have
                      strong norms and a low tolerance of deviant behavior-and those that are
                      "loose"-have weak norms and a high tolerance of deviant behavior." (p.
                      1100). Research has indicated that this dimension is especially helpful
                      in predicting ecological and historical threats between nations (e.g.,
                      high population density, resource scarcity, a history of territorial
                      conflict, and disease and environmental threats), or institutional
                      regulations (e.g., autocracy, media regulations).

                      (3)     Ethical ideologies of idealism and relativism
                      
                      Cultures can be also differentiated by the type of ethical ideology that
                      pre-dominates our thinking. These differences often are the sources of
                      misunderstandings and conflicts. Therefore, it is important to be aware
                      of these differences. We measured the two dimensions of ethical
                      ideology: relativism and idealism (Forsyth, 1980). Relativism is a
                      dimension reflecting the "extent to which the individual rejects
                      universal moral rules when drawing conclusions about moral questions,
                      whereas others believe in and make use of moral absolutes" (p. 175). In
                      contrast, idealism refers to a dimension with the extremes of either
                      believing that desirable actions can always be achieved with right
                      action or believing that desirable actions will always be mixed with
                      undesirable ones.

                    - A learning rate of L, means that each time the production doubles, then the time needed for producing a unit will equal the original production time multiplied by L    
                      "T2n = L*Tn where Tn is time needed for nth product and L the learning rate * only used for doubling!"

                            - Would this company be allowed, by its parent, to start delivering different or additional services and products? For instance, a municipal department of Waste Management might not be allowed to deliver for-profit cleaning services.
                        - Would this company be allowed, by its parent, to start delivering different or additional services and products? 
                            - For instance, a municipal department of Waste Management might not be allowed to deliver for-profit cleaning services.
                        - Would this company be allowed, by its parent, to switch to a new supplier of products or product components? 
                            - For instance, a local sales organization of a large multinational brand probably cannot be supplied by (or resell) a competing brand.
                        - Would this company be allowed, by its parent, to expand geographically? 
                            - For instance, a Dutch division of a company cannot expand its markets to Germany if a German division is active there.

                  •Wikipedia is NOT a valid academic source
                  •Use the word limit to your advantage (don‘ t submit papers with 2100 words when 5000 are allowed)
                  •Read the WS carefully: I go through the WS point by point and you will be downgraded if you just write some „ general remarks“
                  •Read the textbook: You MUST know how to apply the theories"

I will have finished my 'techniques of a selling writer' book and started on a rough draft of a fantasy novel ( rough draft on recyclable  parchment). I will get out into the dutch world and feel at home in rotterdam and surrounding environment. I will maintain a regular public blog(on www.medium.com) for my online presence and a personal one for introspection. My behavior will be less sporadic and moody. I will be reliable and consistent in executing my tasks and goals. I will ensure leisure weekends to kill steam and relax so that i dont implode.  I will have a balance with social and career oriented activities. My knowledge will  continuously expanding by keeping up to date on target news specific to my goal at that moment. My goals will be map-reduced into manageable chunks that i will continuously tackle and accomplish. Will complete at least 1 MOOC online and obtain a certificate of accomplishment ( preferably in Big Data). My lifestyle will be the result of efforts; a happy one. "

I will observe and take note of my environment. Learning, analyzing and making decisions on friendships/relationship that i should foster and others that i should sever. "
                - Given what you know now, what are some of the things that you can do in the coming 2 months to obtain these goals?

                        - Use an array to store all the questions. Each question, along with its choices and correct answer, should be stored in an object. The array of questions should look similar to this:
                          "// Only one question is in this array, but you will add all the questions
                          var allQuestions = [{question: "Who is Prime Minister of the United Kingdom?", choices: ["David Cameron", "Gordon Brown", "Winston Churchill", "Tony Blair"], correctAnswer:0}];"
                        - Dynamically (with document.getElementById or jQuery) add the next question and remove the current question from the screen, when the user clicks the “Next” button. The Next button will be the only button to navigate this version of the quiz.

                    - Def JS : 10, 14, 17, and 20
                    - Project : Improve Your Quiz Application From Earlier:
                        - — Add client-side data validation: make sure the user answers each question before proceeding to the next question.
                        - — Add a “Back” button to allow the user to go back and change her answer. The user can go back up to the first question. For the questions that the user has answered already, be sure to show the radio button selected, so that the user is not forced to answer the questions again, which she has completed.
                        - — Use jQuery to add animation (fade out the current question and fade in the next question).
                        - — Test the quiz on IE 8 and 9, and fix any bugs. This will give you a good workout
                        - — Add user authentication: allow users log in, and save their login credentials to local storage (HTML5 browser storage).
                        - — Store the quiz questions in an external JSON file.
                        - — Use cookies to remember the user, and show a “Welcome, First Name” message when the user returns to the quiz.
                    - Def JS: 9, 18, 21, and 22
                    - Project: Improve Your Quiz Application Even Further:
                        - — Use Twitter Bootstrap for the entire page layout, including the quiz elements to make it look more professional. As an added bonus, use thetabs user interface component from Twitter Bootstrap and show 4 different quizzes, one on each tab.
                        - — Learn Handlebars.js and add Handlebars.js templating to the quiz. You should no longer have any HTML in your JavaScript code. Your quiz is getting more advanced bit by bit.
                        - — Keep a record of all the users who take the quiz and show each user how her score ranks amongst the scores from other quiz takers.

                                - 2 eggs (include the yolks)
                                - 2 garlic cloves (finely minced)
                                - 6 shiitake mushrooms (chopped)
                                - ¾ cup green onions (chopped)
                                - 2 tablespoons sesame oil

                                - 1 teaspoon ground ginger
                                - 3 tablespoon coconut aminos

                                - ½ teaspoon sea salt
                                - ½ lime (juice of)
                            - Steps
                                - Place skillet under medium heat and add sesame oil. Once oil is hot, sauté minced garlic for about 1-2 minutes.
                                - When your minced garlic has taken a brownish color, add in shitake mushrooms to the pan and sauté for another minute or two.
                                - Once both have sautéed well, remove from heat and let them cool for a bit.
                                - Add eggs, coconut aminos, lime juice, almond flour, ground ginger and sea salt to your mixing bowl; whisk ingredients together. Add in ground turkey and combine all ingredients well.
                                - Add in minced garlic and mushrooms to your ground turkey mixture and mix together.
                                - Using your hands, create palm size patties and set them on your large plate (you’ll take them all out to be grilled in a bit. FUN!)
                                - Turn your grill on. Once hot, place patties on the grill and let them cook for about 4 minutes (watch your patties carefully, do not let them burn!)
                                - Using your grilling tools (spatula) turn patties around and let the other side cook for about 4 minutes.
                                - Let patties cool down a bit and enjoy them with a nice garden salad!

                            - group words into motivation-reaction units (MRUs)
                            - group MRUs into scenes & sequels
                            - group scenes and sequels into story pattern
                            - create characters that give a story life
                        - writer should have theories on every phase of writing: gettin ideas, plotting, building conflict, brining characters to life, creating right feelings in a given reader; #star
                        - Perseverance; initiative is the key; crawl before we walk and that journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step(corollary: followed by many more steps); you the writer must execute your work as wel as plan them; rules are objective, objective isnt a story ; feeling (which is subjective) is the place where every story starts; rule 1: find that feeling ; "The man who knows how will always find a place in life, but the man who knows why willl be the boss" ;  take note of the why behind each and every how; retain your ability to react uniquely; 
                        - the proceure of separation of the mind, altering between creation and critique is the most effective way to learn in any creative field; rules as a checklist, not a blueprint; feeling dominates, not logic;

                                                - 5. you heighten the effect, by describing the stimulus in terms that reflect your FCs attitude
                                        - b. pertinence to your story
                                          "the pertinent stimulus is one relevant to the matter at hand, the immediate issue"
                                            - 1. stimulus must show change in external world - FCs state of affairs
                                            - 2. external change much be such as logically to evoke some change in his internal world - FCs state of mind

                                            - Not just: is the issue relevant to immediate issue? but also does it keep the story itself on target
                                        - c. motivity to your reader
                                          "the motivating stimulus must spur your FC to action"
                                            - 1 motive stimilus is one which demands response
                                            - 2 response demanded is of such nature as to keep your FC active
                                            - stimulus in context to make imperative immediate, active response from your FC
                                            - motivity is of degree and pacing, not an absolute
                                    - Character Reaction
                                        - a. significant
                                            - reaction significant only when it reflects precisely the image you seek to create. it must capture the exact shadings and nuances of mood. Tenderness can be a thing of infinite gradation, and so can cruelty or rejection or lust
                                            - "You must decide, definitely, and concretely on your character"

                                            - Decision made, you must implement it with the right reaction - demonstrate your character's character and state of mind in terms of things he feels/thinks/does/say

                                          "moves him down teh road you want him to follow"
                                        - c. motive
                                          "motive reactions allows your character to respond actively to whatever happens; also effect/further change in the world outside your fc"

                                        - e. reasonable
                                          "reaction make sense in terms of the motivating stimulus he received"
                                    - "You (the writer), first, must see each MS as your FC sees it, with his background, his attitudes, his dynamics and insights. Then you let him react in character."
                            - The problem of proportion
                              "measure copy length with tension"
                                - How do you decide how much attention to give each element, each segment? Answer: you write to fit. To fit feelings. Measure feelings with emotional clock.
                                - two kinds of time: chronometrical( objective)  and emotional (relative, subjective and based on feelings)
                                  "Einstein: "When a man sits with a pretty girl for an hour, it seems like a minute.  But let him sit on a hot stove for a minute, and it's longer than an hour.""
                                - Tension gives emo time a wide range. Fear is behind tension.
                                - "In writing, you translate tension into space: the more tense the situation as your FC experiences it, the more words you give it. "
                                - Danger = objective. Fear = subjective. 
                                  "can't translate danger into fear until he because aware of it; once aware then fear.. a subjective alarm signal that puts you on an emotional war footing... mobilizes all your resources of energy and alertness for self-preservative effort"
                                - Any change in state of affairs (changes in teh external circumstance) brings with it the potentiality for danger. Why? Because FC must readjust! - in brief he faces a change in state of mind
                                  "forces him to choose a course of action -> and yet, should he really? infinite outcomes - so your FC hangs on teetering on the brink of action - reconsidering his situation, re-evaluating his potion, trying to decide whether or not the game is worth the candle"
                                - "Always, the points you bear down on are those that influence the development of your story. The time you need detail is when your FCs state of mind changes. The place to summarize is where no such change takes place."
                                - To what degree afford to summarize? answer: you may bridge almost any amount of time or space, so long as your character's problem and state of mind remain essentially the same
                                - Why us a lot of detail at moments of crucial change?
                                    - impress your reader with the event's importance
                                    - give proportion to your presentation 
                                      "lay it out not on a plain or plateau, but in peaks and valleys"
                                    - build up the scene and milk it dry of every drop of drama
                                    - make it aboslutely clear to your  reader precisely why your character does as he does
                                      "the pattern hiis thought and feelings follow: the strengths and weakness of his logic"
                                    - External factors which influence your Character's degree of tension and hence the amount of detail in which you present the incident
                                      "five aspects of this objective segment are:"
                                        - necessity of readjustment in your FC,( and thus change state of mind)
                                        - degree of change
                                        - immediacy of change
                                        - difficulty of decision
                                        - difficulty of action
                                    - To clarify anything, or build up its importance, demands fragmentation
                                    - Recapitulation:
                                        - summarize facts and mechanics
                                        - detail that which is so emotionally pertinent that it holds the potentiality of creating tension or otherwise changing your FCs state of mind
                            - Writing the M-R unit 

                                - a. write a sentence without your character - motivation
                                  "your FC does not appear by noun or pronoun anywhere"
                                - b. follow with a sentence about your character - reaction 
                                  "FC reaction in consequence of motivation sentence"
                                - To mantain flow of mounting emotional intensity in your copy, continue to alternate sentences ( or, if need be, larger nunits) of stimulus and response, cause and effect, motivation and reaction.
                                  "pg 81 for example!"
                                - Rising action is an interaction. For just as your FC reacts to his external motivation, so the world outside reacts to him. 
                            - Write first. Then go back over your copy and check to make sure each reaction is motivated ( that its not choppy writing); that each MS gets a reaction; and that ineptitude in use of language hasnot in any way confused the issue
                    - Conflicts and How to Build It
                      "chapter 4: a story is a chain of scenes and sequels"

                                    - Assume hero is strong and will do at 'nothing' to attain goal! however, endles rehashign of a single issue soon grows dreary...

                                      "a lot of fumbling for an angle by the hero"
                                    - Meat is gained. Thanks to new developments, new complications, action an interest continually rise. Stimulation by seeming progress of opposition, puts renewed effort. This in turn intensifies reader excitement over which side will be victorious.

                                - A few objections:
                                    - FC has no starting goal?

                                        - disaster is one of the best device for this effect
                                        - you can make disaster potential (hint at) and not actual
                                        - you might play other side of the record and set him up to ride for a fall

                                    - always have an orientation even if its not 
                                    - FC's goal is weak or diffuse?
                                        - keep the goal a short-range proposition
                                          "something he can logically strive to achieve, in a relatively limited, time-unified, face-to-face encounter"
                                        - be ruthless in forcing yourself to reduce said goal into a single , photographable act
                                        - a goal is the target your FC shoots for in order to unify a particular scene so keep it dominant
                                    - FC is weak?
                                      "why doesnt he quit? if enough is at stake for him, he'll fight!"
                                    - Scene lacks urgency? time pressure.

                                    - the disaster isnt indigenous to the scene? need to be logical

                            - Topic unifies sequel!
                              "the subject is the FC's reaction to his plight, the problem the preceding scene posed"
                            - Structure:
                              "pg 100, 101, 102 good examples"
                                - Reaction
                                    - Whats his state of affairs & of mind after disaster from previous scene?
                                      "of affairs generally revealed in the reaction of others to your char's disaster, rouse fears that are (introvertly) inspected?"
                                    - what is the FC to do now? The (over)thinking/feeling on the disastrous emotion resulting - things can happen but they dont matter insofar as it lends reality to themoment; disaster all that counts and your FC's preoccupation with it
                                - Dilemma
                                  "your FC situation involving choice between equally unsatisfactory alternatives"
                                    - give reader chance to suffer and worry about the FC
                                    - considers possibilities, seeing the weakness in each, but ultimately seeing a reason FC can't quit
                                    - Add : incidents or happenings for a touch of realism - they dont hold enough interest/importance to sustain attention for long so speed pass em!
                                      "incident: goals achieved without resistance/conflict , nevertheless stays preoccupied with previous scene disaster
                                      happenings:bringing people together but they are nondramatic, no goals or conflict, "
                                - Decision
                                  "until he sets up an anser, a new goal emerges that will give rise to further conflicts"
                                    - logically, plausibly sequel has brought it has been brought into being 
                                    - it might be a longshot, it might backfire, but under circumstances, its worth a try, he knows this, pressure is on, conflict will follow
                        - To build a story lay out a pattern of scene... sequel... scene.. sequel... etc
                        - Side note: You could abstract a scene as an ultimate big motivation, and scene as reaction to deciding the next big goal?
                        - Writing the Sequel
                          "same technical tricks in ch3 : orientation, motivating stimulus, character reaction, pattern of emotion .."
                            - consequently you write a series of interlocked MR-units
                            - 3 Dos's:
                                - establish time, place, circumstances, and viewpoint at the very start of each scene
                                - demonstrate quickly that some character has a scene goal
                                  "show purpose, make him act as if he has a goal, specifc, imoportant, right now "
                                    - better shown with senses than told
                                    -  avoid merely acted upon, in most scenes he should be the aggressor - active, dynamic, driving forward
                                - build to a curtain line
                                  "written so that disaster comes suddenly and unanticipated"
                            - 3 Don'ts
                                - write too small
                                  "scenes are important, need space to build emotion, add : color, maneauvering, conflict, complicaiton, punch and counterpunch, unantcipated devs"
                                - dont go into flashbacks
                                - dont accidentally summarize
                                  "see pg 108+ for solution to examples"
                                    - "he told her that .. " 
                                      "you want speech - the genuine article down to the last slur and contraction"
                                    - "he hunted for the elevator without succes"
                                      "what you tell me, but i want to see what happens"
                                    - "time passed"
                                      "then just skip to when things start to happens"
                                    - "The thing to bear in mind is that nothing ever really comes alive in summary. Life is lived moment by moment, in TEchnicolor detail. To capture it on paper, you have to break behavior down into precise and pertinent fragments of motivation and response"
                        - Writing the Sequel
                            - Topic unifies sequel, topic is being preoccupied with a particular set of feelings
                              "until decision, feeling will be that of uppermost importance in your mind"
                            - you move across an emotional bride, subordinating factions, emphasizing feelings
                            - Compresson
                              "the problem of proportion"
                                - few details -> wordage importance -> symbolic fragment
                                  "single feature that captures the essence, lone item, brought into close-up, speaks volumes about your character's sate of mind"
                            - Transition
                              "need to bridge time or space or mood or circumstance"
                                - you spotlight the dominant feeling
                                - emphasize that feeling immediately before the lapse in time, space or actio... then immediately after said lapse ends
                                  "ex: guilt; "Sleep came quicky, easily to his surprise. Only then he wished it hadn't, because it brought strange, dark, half-nightmares with it... weird dreams in which Irene somehow always stood beside him, mute, dark eyes accusing.
                                  	The sense of guilt those images engendered still nagged at him when he deplaned in Tulsa Monday morning. " .."
                            - Credibility
                                - set your FC against a backdrop of realistic detail
                                  "elements of the familiar into your story"
                                - push your FC in the right direction
                                  "using external motivators "
                                - let your reader see FC's chain of logic
                                  "give your FC a chance to think things through, maybe even flashbacks"
                        - Integrating Scene & Sequel
                            - you control story pacing by the way you proportion scene to sequel
                              "big scenes = big interest; big sequels = greater plausibility"
                                - gets boring? strength and enlarge scene. Build conflict
                                - air of improbability? lengthen sequels
                            - scenes dominate story development
                                - how big you build a scene depends considerably on its placement  in the story
                                  "arrange your scenes, your peaks, in order of ascending importance and/or intensity"
                                - small scenes may be reduced to sequels; to routine
                            - flexibility is all-important
                                - build impact if you allow a time-break directly after a scene-disaster's curtain line
                                  "as if numb by shock " "

These special people can exit their body and enter others, control them for a period of time until they get hungry? need to refuel their 'vessel'  by eating physically and meditating. They dont need to sleep.  Their sleeping/dreaming is their out of body experience ; although they burn more calories and have become 'fatburners' therefore to sustain themselves best? They can also battle in dreammode but its more like videogaming - all imaginative and they reset upon death but they feel the pain nonetheless.

                            - Idea -> Mockup -> Prototype -> Program -> Product -> Business 0> Profits
                            - It's not the idea, it's the execution!
                            - That is, given a good idea for a product, a strong team will execute on that idea and push through all the details (financial, regulatory, technical, legal) to get that product to market.
                              "Marc Andreessen:
                              
                              Personally, I’ll take the third position – I’ll assert that market is the most important
                              factor in a startup’s success or failure.
                              Why?
                              In a great market – a market with lots of real potential customers – the market
                              pulls product out of the startup. The market needs to be fulfilled and the market
                              will be fulfilled, by the first viable product that comes along. The product doesn’t
                              need to be great; it just has to basically work. And, the market doesn’t care how
                              good the team is, as long as the team can produce that viable product."

                              DESCRIPTION
                                     In  the  1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.  In
                                     the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current directory.  In the
                                     3rd  and  4th  forms, create links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.  Create
                                     hard links by default, symbolic links with --symbolic.   When  creating
                                     hard  links, each TARGET must exist.  Symbolic links can hold arbitrary
                                     text; if later resolved, a relative link is interpreted in relation  to
                                     its parent directory."

                            - These normally break down as follows:
                            - dev: Working code copy. Changes made by developers are deployed here so integration and features can be tested. This environment is rapidly updated and contains the most recent version of the application.
                            - qa: (Not all companies will have this). Environment for quality assurance; this provides a less frequently changed version of the application which testers can perform checks against. This allows reporting on a common revision so developers know whether particular issues found by testers has already been corrected in the development code.
                            - staging: This is the release candidate, and this environment is normally a mirror of the production environment. The staging area contains the "next" version of the application and is used for final stress testing and client/manager approvals before going live.
                            - production: This is the currently released version of the application, accessible to the client/end users. This version preferably does not change except for during scheduled releases.

                            - 2. The browser parses the URL to find the protocol, host, port, and path
                            - 3. If HTTP was specified, it forms a HTTP request.
                            - 4.  doing a DNS lookup on the host 
                              "To reach the host, it first needs to translate the human readable host into an IP address, and it does this by"
                            - 5. Then a socket needs to be opened from the user’s computer to that IP address, on the port specified (most often port 80 for HTTP).
                            - 6. When a network connection is open, the HTTP request is sent to the host. The details of this connection are specified in the 7-layer OSI model
                            - 7. The host forwards the request to the server software (most often Apache) configured tolisten on the specified port. 
                            - 8. The server inspects the request (most often only the path), and the subsequent behavior depends on the type of site:
                                - For static content:
                                  "HTTP response does not change as a function of the user, time of day,geographic location, or other parameters (such as HTTP Request headers)."
                                    - static web server like nginx can rapidly serve
                                      "the html/css/js and binary files(jpg,mp4 etc.)"
                                - For dynamic content:
                                  " HTTP response does change as a function of the user, time of day, geographical location etc"
                                    - forward dynamic requests from a web-server like nginx (or Apache) to a constantly running server-side daemon (like mod_wsgi hosting Django or node.js behind nginx), with the static requests intercepted and returned by nginx (or even before via caching layers).
                                    - The server-side web framework you use (such as Python / Django, Ruby / Rails, or node.js / Express) gets access to the full request, and starts to prepare a HTTP response. 
                                      "A web framework is a collection of related libraries for working with HTTP responses and requests (and other things)"
                                    - To construct the HTTP response a relational database is often accessed
                                    - While sometimes raw SQL is used to access the database, modern web frameworks allow engineers to access data via so-called Object-Relational Mappers {ORMs), such as sequelize.js (for node.js) or the Django ORM (for Python)
                                      "ORM provides a high-level way of manipulating data within your language after defining some model"
                                    - The specific data for the current HTTP request is often obtained via a database search using the ORM, based on parameters in the path (or data) of the request.
                                    - The objects created via the ORM are then used to template an HTML page (server-side templating), to directly return JSON (for usage in APIs or clientside templating), or to otherwise populate the body of the HTTP Response. This body is then conceptually put in an envelope with HTTP Response headers as metadata labeling that envelope.
                                    - The web framework then returns the HTTP response back to the browser.
                            - 9. The browser receives the response. Assuming for now that the web framework used server-side templating and return HTML, this HTML is parsed. Importantly, the browser must be robust to broken or misformatted HTML
                            - 10. A Document Object Model (DOM) tree is built out of the HTML. The DOM is a tree structure representation of a webpage.
                            - 11. All browsers provide a standard programmatic Javascript API for interacting with the DOM, though today most engineers manipulate the DOM through the cross-browser JQuery library or higher-level frameworks like Backbone.
                            - 12. New requests are made to the server for each new resource that is found in the HTML source (typically images, style sheets, and JavaScript files). Go back to step 3 and repeat for each resource.
                            - 13. CSS is parsed, and used to annotate each node in the DOM tree with style information on how it should render.
                              "css controls appearence"
                            - 14. Javascript is parsed and executed, and DOM nodes are moved and style information is updated accordingly
                              "Javascript controls behavior, and the Javascript executed on page load can be used to move nodes around or change appearance (by updating or setting CSS styles)"
                            - 15. The browser renders the page on the screen according to the DOM tree and the final style information for each node.
                            - 16. You see the webpage and can interact with it by clicking on buttons or submitting forms. Every link you click or form you submit sends another HTTP request to a server, and the process repeats.

                                          I was at Amazon for about six and a half years, and now I've been at Google for that long. One thing that struck me immediately about the two companies -- an impression that has been reinforced almost daily -- is that Amazon does everything wrong, and Google does everything right. Sure, it's a sweeping generalization, but a surprisingly accurate one. It's pretty crazy. There are probably a hundred or even two hundred different ways you can compare the two companies, and Google is superior in all but three of them, if I recall correctly. I actually did a spreadsheet at one point but Legal wouldn't let me show it to anyone, even though recruiting loved it.
                                          
                                          I mean, just to give you a very brief taste: Amazon's recruiting process is fundamentally flawed by having teams hire for themselves, so their hiring bar is incredibly inconsistent across teams, despite various efforts they've made to level it out. And their operations are a mess; they don't really have SREs and they make engineers pretty much do everything, which leaves almost no time for coding - though again this varies by group, so it's luck of the draw. They don't give a single shit about charity or helping the needy or community contributions or anything like that. Never comes up there, except maybe to laugh about it. Their facilities are dirt-smeared cube farms without a dime spent on decor or common meeting areas. Their pay and benefits suck, although much less so lately due to local competition from Google and Facebook. But they don't have any of our perks or extras -- they just try to match the offer-letter numbers, and that's the end of it. Their code base is a disaster, with no engineering standards whatsoever except what individual teams choose to put in place.
                                          
                                          To be fair, they do have a nice versioned-library system that we really ought to emulate, and a nice publish-subscribe system that we also have no equivalent for. But for the most part they just have a bunch of crappy tools that read and write state machine information into relational databases. We wouldn't take most of it even if it were free.
                                          
                                          I think the pubsub system and their library-shelf system were two out of the grand total of three things Amazon does better than google.
                                          
                                          I guess you could make an argument that their bias for launching early and iterating like mad is also something they do well, but you can argue it either way. They prioritize launching early over everything else, including retention and engineering discipline and a bunch of other stuff that turns out to matter in the long run. So even though it's given them some competitive advantages in the marketplace, it's created enough other problems to make it something less than a slam-dunk.
                                          
                                          But there's one thing they do really really well that pretty much makes up for ALL of their political, philosophical and technical screw-ups.
                                          
                                          Jeff Bezos is an infamous micro-manager. He micro-manages every single pixel of Amazon's retail site. He hired Larry Tesler, Apple's Chief Scientist and probably the very most famous and respected human-computer interaction expert in the entire world, and then ignored every goddamn thing Larry said for three years until Larry finally -- wisely -- left the company. Larry would do these big usability studies and demonstrate beyond any shred of doubt that nobody can understand that frigging website, but Bezos just couldn't let go of those pixels, all those millions of semantics-packed pixels on the landing page. They were like millions of his own precious children. So they're all still there, and Larry is not.
                                          
                                          Micro-managing isn't that third thing that Amazon does better than us, by the way. I mean, yeah, they micro-manage really well, but I wouldn't list it as a strength or anything. I'm just trying to set the context here, to help you understand what happened. We're talking about a guy who in all seriousness has said on many public occasions that people should be paying him to work at Amazon. He hands out little yellow stickies with his name on them, reminding people "who runs the company" when they disagree with him. The guy is a regular... well, Steve Jobs, I guess. Except without the fashion or design sense. Bezos is super smart; don't get me wrong. He just makes ordinary control freaks look like stoned hippies.
                                          
                                          So one day Jeff Bezos issued a mandate. He's doing that all the time, of course, and people scramble like ants being pounded with a rubber mallet whenever it happens. But on one occasion -- back around 2002 I think, plus or minus a year -- he issued a mandate that was so out there, so huge and eye-bulgingly ponderous, that it made all of his other mandates look like unsolicited peer bonuses.
                                          
                                          His Big Mandate went something along these lines:
                                          
                                          1) All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.
                                          
                                          2) Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.
                                          
                                          3) There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team's data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.
                                          
                                          4) It doesn't matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom protocols -- doesn't matter. Bezos doesn't care.
                                          
                                          5) All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.
                                          
                                          6) Anyone who doesn't do this will be fired.
                                          
                                          7) Thank you; have a nice day!
                                          
                                          Ha, ha! You 150-odd ex-Amazon folks here will of course realize immediately that #7 was a little joke I threw in, because Bezos most definitely does not give a shit about your day.
                                          
                                          #6, however, was quite real, so people went to work. Bezos assigned a couple of Chief Bulldogs to oversee the effort and ensure forward progress, headed up by Uber-Chief Bear Bulldog Rick Dalzell. Rick is an ex-Armgy Ranger, West Point Academy graduate, ex-boxer, ex-Chief Torturer slash CIO at Wal*Mart, and is a big genial scary man who used the word "hardened interface" a lot. Rick was a walking, talking hardened interface himself, so needless to say, everyone made LOTS of forward progress and made sure Rick knew about it.
                                          
                                          Over the next couple of years, Amazon transformed internally into a service-oriented architecture. They learned a tremendous amount while effecting this transformation. There was lots of existing documentation and lore about SOAs, but at Amazon's vast scale it was about as useful as telling Indiana Jones to look both ways before crossing the street. Amazon's dev staff made a lot of discoveries along the way. A teeny tiny sampling of these discoveries included:
                                          
                                          - pager escalation gets way harder, because a ticket might bounce through 20 service calls before the real owner is identified. If each bounce goes through a team with a 15-minute response time, it can be hours before the right team finally finds out, unless you build a lot of scaffolding and metrics and reporting.
                                          
                                          - every single one of your peer teams suddenly becomes a potential DOS attacker. Nobody can make any real forward progress until very serious quotas and throttling are put in place in every single service.
                                          
                                          - monitoring and QA are the same thing. You'd never think so until you try doing a big SOA. But when your service says "oh yes, I'm fine", it may well be the case that the only thing still functioning in the server is the little component that knows how to say "I'm fine, roger roger, over and out" in a cheery droid voice. In order to tell whether the service is actually responding, you have to make individual calls. The problem continues recursively until your monitoring is doing comprehensive semantics checking of your entire range of services and data, at which point it's indistinguishable from automated QA. So they're a continuum.
                                          
                                          - if you have hundreds of services, and your code MUST communicate with other groups' code via these services, then you won't be able to find any of them without a service-discovery mechanism. And you can't have that without a service registration mechanism, which itself is another service. So Amazon has a universal service registry where you can find out reflectively (programmatically) about every service, what its APIs are, and also whether it is currently up, and where.
                                          
                                          - debugging problems with someone else's code gets a LOT harder, and is basically impossible unless there is a universal standard way to run every service in a debuggable sandbox.
                                          
                                          That's just a very small sample. There are dozens, maybe hundreds of individual learnings like these that Amazon had to discover organically. There were a lot of wacky ones around externalizing services, but not as many as you might think. Organizing into services taught teams not to trust each other in most of the same ways they're not supposed to trust external developers.
                                          
                                          This effort was still underway when I left to join Google in mid-2005, but it was pretty far advanced. From the time Bezos issued his edict through the time I left, Amazon had transformed culturally into a company that thinks about everything in a services-first fashion. It is now fundamental to how they approach all designs, including internal designs for stuff that might never see the light of day externally.
                                          
                                          At this point they don't even do it out of fear of being fired. I mean, they're still afraid of that; it's pretty much part of daily life there, working for the Dread Pirate Bezos and all. But they do services because they've come to understand that it's the Right Thing. There are without question pros and cons to the SOA approach, and some of the cons are pretty long. But overall it's the right thing because SOA-driven design enables Platforms.
                                          
                                          That's what Bezos was up to with his edict, of course. He didn't (and doesn't) care even a tiny bit about the well-being of the teams, nor about what technologies they use, nor in fact any detail whatsoever about how they go about their business unless they happen to be screwing up. But Bezos realized long before the vast majority of Amazonians that Amazon needs to be a platform.
                                          
                                          You wouldn't really think that an online bookstore needs to be an extensible, programmable platform. Would you?
                                          
                                          Well, the first big thing Bezos realized is that the infrastructure they'd built for selling and shipping books and sundry could be transformed an excellent repurposable computing platform. So now they have the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and the Amazon Elastic MapReduce, and the Amazon Relational Database Service, and a whole passel' o' other services browsable at aws.amazon.com. These services host the backends for some pretty successful companies, reddit being my personal favorite of the bunch.
                                          
                                          The other big realization he had was that he can't always build the right thing. I think Larry Tesler might have struck some kind of chord in Bezos when he said his mom couldn't use the goddamn website. It's not even super clear whose mom he was talking about, and doesn't really matter, because nobody's mom can use the goddamn website. In fact I myself find the website disturbingly daunting, and I worked there for over half a decade. I've just learned to kinda defocus my eyes and concentrate on the million or so pixels near the center of the page above the fold.
                                          
                                          I'm not really sure how Bezos came to this realization -- the insight that he can't build one product and have it be right for everyone. But it doesn't matter, because he gets it. There's actually a formal name for this phenomenon. It's called Accessibility, and it's the most important thing in the computing world.
                                          
                                          The. Most. Important. Thing.
                                          
                                          If you're sorta thinking, "huh? You mean like, blind and deaf people Accessibility?" then you're not alone, because I've come to understand that there are lots and LOTS of people just like you: people for whom this idea does not have the right Accessibility, so it hasn't been able to get through to you yet. It's not your fault for not understanding, any more than it would be your fault for being blind or deaf or motion-restricted or living with any other disability. When software -- or idea-ware for that matter -- fails to be accessible to anyone for any reason, it is the fault of the software or of the messaging of the idea. It is an Accessibility failure.
                                          
                                          Like anything else big and important in life, Accessibility has an evil twin who, jilted by the unbalanced affection displayed by their parents in their youth, has grown into an equally powerful Arch-Nemesis (yes, there's more than one nemesis to accessibility) named Security. And boy howdy are the two ever at odds.
                                          
                                          But I'll argue that Accessibility is actually more important than Security because dialing Accessibility to zero means you have no product at all, whereas dialing Security to zero can still get you a reasonably successful product such as the Playstation Network.
                                          
                                          So yeah. In case you hadn't noticed, I could actually write a book on this topic. A fat one, filled with amusing anecdotes about ants and rubber mallets at companies I've worked at. But I will never get this little rant published, and you'll never get it read, unless I start to wrap up.
                                          
                                          That one last thing that Google doesn't do well is Platforms. We don't understand platforms. We don't "get" platforms. Some of you do, but you are the minority. This has become painfully clear to me over the past six years. I was kind of hoping that competitive pressure from Microsoft and Amazon and more recently Facebook would make us wake up collectively and start doing universal services. Not in some sort of ad-hoc, half-assed way, but in more or less the same way Amazon did it: all at once, for real, no cheating, and treating it as our top priority from now on.
                                          
                                          But no. No, it's like our tenth or eleventh priority. Or fifteenth, I don't know. It's pretty low. There are a few teams who treat the idea very seriously, but most teams either don't think about it all, ever, or only a small percentage of them think about it in a very small way.
                                          
                                          It's a big stretch even to get most teams to offer a stubby service to get programmatic access to their data and computations. Most of them think they're building products. And a stubby service is a pretty pathetic service. Go back and look at that partial list of learnings from Amazon, and tell me which ones Stubby gives you out of the box. As far as I'm concerned, it's none of them. Stubby's great, but it's like parts when you need a car.
                                          
                                          A product is useless without a platform, or more precisely and accurately, a platform-less product will always be replaced by an equivalent platform-ized product.
                                          
                                          Google+ is a prime example of our complete failure to understand platforms from the very highest levels of executive leadership (hi Larry, Sergey, Eric, Vic, howdy howdy) down to the very lowest leaf workers (hey yo). We all don't get it. The Golden Rule of platforms is that you Eat Your Own Dogfood. The Google+ platform is a pathetic afterthought. We had no API at all at launch, and last I checked, we had one measly API call. One of the team members marched in and told me about it when they launched, and I asked: "So is it the Stalker API?" She got all glum and said "Yeah." I mean, I was joking, but no... the only API call we offer is to get someone's stream. So I guess the joke was on me.
                                          
                                          Microsoft has known about the Dogfood rule for at least twenty years. It's been part of their culture for a whole generation now. You don't eat People Food and give your developers Dog Food. Doing that is simply robbing your long-term platform value for short-term successes. Platforms are all about long-term thinking.
                                          
                                          Google+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product. But that's not why they are successful. Facebook is successful because they built an entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do the work. So Facebook is different for everyone. Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars. Some spend all their time on Farmville. There are hundreds or maybe thousands of different high-quality time sinks available, so there's something there for everyone.
                                          
                                          Our Google+ team took a look at the aftermarket and said: "Gosh, it looks like we need some games. Let's go contract someone to, um, write some games for us." Do you begin to see how incredibly wrong that thinking is now? The problem is that we are trying to predict what people want and deliver it for them.
                                          
                                          You can't do that. Not really. Not reliably. There have been precious few people in the world, over the entire history of computing, who have been able to do it reliably. Steve Jobs was one of them. We don't have a Steve Jobs here. I'm sorry, but we don't.
                                          
                                          Larry Tesler may have convinced Bezos that he was no Steve Jobs, but Bezos realized that he didn't need to be a Steve Jobs in order to provide everyone with the right products: interfaces and workflows that they liked and felt at ease with. He just needed to enable third-party developers to do it, and it would happen automatically.
                                          
                                          I apologize to those (many) of you for whom all this stuff I'm saying is incredibly obvious, because yeah. It's incredibly frigging obvious. Except we're not doing it. We don't get Platforms, and we don't get Accessibility. The two are basically the same thing, because platforms solve accessibility. A platform is accessibility.
                                          
                                          So yeah, Microsoft gets it. And you know as well as I do how surprising that is, because they don't "get" much of anything, really. But they understand platforms as a purely accidental outgrowth of having started life in the business of providing platforms. So they have thirty-plus years of learning in this space. And if you go to msdn.com, and spend some time browsing, and you've never seen it before, prepare to be amazed. Because it's staggeringly huge. They have thousands, and thousands, and THOUSANDS of API calls. They have a HUGE platform. Too big in fact, because they can't design for squat, but at least they're doing it.
                                          
                                          Amazon gets it. Amazon's AWS (aws.amazon.com) is incredible. Just go look at it. Click around. It's embarrassing. We don't have any of that stuff.
                                          
                                          Apple gets it, obviously. They've made some fundamentally non-open choices, particularly around their mobile platform. But they understand accessibility and they understand the power of third-party development and they eat their dogfood. And you know what? They make pretty good dogfood. Their APIs are a hell of a lot cleaner than Microsoft's, and have been since time immemorial.
                                          
                                          Facebook gets it. That's what really worries me. That's what got me off my lazy butt to write this thing. I hate blogging. I hate... plussing, or whatever it's called when you do a massive rant in Google+ even though it's a terrible venue for it but you do it anyway because in the end you really do want Google to be successful. And I do! I mean, Facebook wants me there, and it'd be pretty easy to just go. But Google is home, so I'm insisting that we have this little family intervention, uncomfortable as it might be.
                                          
                                          After you've marveled at the platform offerings of Microsoft and Amazon, and Facebook I guess (I didn't look because I didn't want to get too depressed), head over to developers.google.com and browse a little. Pretty big difference, eh? It's like what your fifth-grade nephew might mock up if he were doing an assignment to demonstrate what a big powerful platform company might be building if all they had, resource-wise, was one fifth grader.
                                          
                                          Please don't get me wrong here -- I know for a fact that the dev-rel team has had to FIGHT to get even this much available externally. They're kicking ass as far as I'm concerned, because they DO get platforms, and they are struggling heroically to try to create one in an environment that is at best platform-apathetic, and at worst often openly hostile to the idea.
                                          
                                          I'm just frankly describing what developers.google.com looks like to an outsider. It looks childish. Where's the Maps APIs in there for Christ's sake? Some of the things in there are labs projects. And the APIs for everything I clicked were... they were paltry. They were obviously dog food. Not even good organic stuff. Compared to our internal APIs it's all snouts and horse hooves.
                                          
                                          And also don't get me wrong about Google+. They're far from the only offenders. This is a cultural thing. What we have going on internally is basically a war, with the underdog minority Platformers fighting a more or less losing battle against the Mighty Funded Confident Producters.
                                          
                                          Any teams that have successfully internalized the notion that they should be externally programmable platforms from the ground up are underdogs -- Maps and Docs come to mind, and I know GMail is making overtures in that direction. But it's hard for them to get funding for it because it's not part of our culture. Maestro's funding is a feeble thing compared to the gargantuan Microsoft Office programming platform: it's a fluffy rabbit versus a T-Rex. The Docs team knows they'll never be competitive with Office until they can match its scripting facilities, but they're not getting any resource love. I mean, I assume they're not, given that Apps Script only works in Spreadsheet right now, and it doesn't even have keyboard shortcuts as part of its API. That team looks pretty unloved to me.
                                          
                                          Ironically enough, Wave was a great platform, may they rest in peace. But making something a platform is not going to make you an instant success. A platform needs a killer app. Facebook -- that is, the stock service they offer with walls and friends and such -- is the killer app for the Facebook Platform. And it is a very serious mistake to conclude that the Facebook App could have been anywhere near as successful without the Facebook Platform.
                                          
                                          You know how people are always saying Google is arrogant? I'm a Googler, so I get as irritated as you do when people say that. We're not arrogant, by and large. We're, like, 99% Arrogance-Free. I did start this post -- if you'll reach back into distant memory -- by describing Google as "doing everything right". We do mean well, and for the most part when people say we're arrogant it's because we didn't hire them, or they're unhappy with our policies, or something along those lines. They're inferring arrogance because it makes them feel better.
                                          
                                          But when we take the stance that we know how to design the perfect product for everyone, and believe you me, I hear that a lot, then we're being fools. You can attribute it to arrogance, or naivete, or whatever -- it doesn't matter in the end, because it's foolishness. There IS no perfect product for everyone.
                                          
                                          And so we wind up with a browser that doesn't let you set the default font size. Talk about an affront to Accessibility. I mean, as I get older I'm actually going blind. For real. I've been nearsighted all my life, and once you hit 40 years old you stop being able to see things up close. So font selection becomes this life-or-death thing: it can lock you out of the product completely. But the Chrome team is flat-out arrogant here: they want to build a zero-configuration product, and they're quite brazen about it, and Fuck You if you're blind or deaf or whatever. Hit Ctrl-+ on every single page visit for the rest of your life.
                                          
                                          It's not just them. It's everyone. The problem is that we're a Product Company through and through. We built a successful product with broad appeal -- our search, that is -- and that wild success has biased us.
                                          
                                          Amazon was a product company too, so it took an out-of-band force to make Bezos understand the need for a platform. That force was their evaporating margins; he was cornered and had to think of a way out. But all he had was a bunch of engineers and all these computers... if only they could be monetized somehow... you can see how he arrived at AWS, in hindsight.
                                          
                                          Microsoft started out as a platform, so they've just had lots of practice at it.
                                          
                                          Facebook, though: they worry me. I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure they started off as a Product and they rode that success pretty far. So I'm not sure exactly how they made the transition to a platform. It was a relatively long time ago, since they had to be a platform before (now very old) things like Mafia Wars could come along.
                                          
                                          Maybe they just looked at us and asked: "How can we beat Google? What are they missing?"
                                          
                                          The problem we face is pretty huge, because it will take a dramatic cultural change in order for us to start catching up. We don't do internal service-oriented platforms, and we just as equally don't do external ones. This means that the "not getting it" is endemic across the company: the PMs don't get it, the engineers don't get it, the product teams don't get it, nobody gets it. Even if individuals do, even if YOU do, it doesn't matter one bit unless we're treating it as an all-hands-on-deck emergency. We can't keep launching products and pretending we'll turn them into magical beautiful extensible platforms later. We've tried that and it's not working.
                                          
                                          The Golden Rule of Platforms, "Eat Your Own Dogfood", can be rephrased as "Start with a Platform, and Then Use it for Everything." You can't just bolt it on later. Certainly not easily at any rate -- ask anyone who worked on platformizing MS Office. Or anyone who worked on platformizing Amazon. If you delay it, it'll be ten times as much work as just doing it correctly up front. You can't cheat. You can't have secret back doors for internal apps to get special priority access, not for ANY reason. You need to solve the hard problems up front.
                                          
                                          I'm not saying it's too late for us, but the longer we wait, the closer we get to being Too Late.
                                          
                                          I honestly don't know how to wrap this up. I've said pretty much everything I came here to say today. This post has been six years in the making. I'm sorry if I wasn't gentle enough, or if I misrepresented some product or team or person, or if we're actually doing LOTS of platform stuff and it just so happens that I and everyone I ever talk to has just never heard about it. I'm sorry.

                                    -  All Android Phones and iPhones have easy access to a SQL database called SQLite and many applications on your phone use it directly.
                                      "SQL based on Relational Algebra: based on a solid mathematically built theory of operation; learning SQL, you actually will learn important theoretical concepts that apply to nearly every data storage system past and present."

                                    - SQL ONLY KNOWS TABLES. SQL LOVES TABLES. SQL ONLY RETURNS TABLES.
                                    - SQL only knows tables, and every operation produces tables. It either "produces" a table by modifying an existing one, or it returns a new temporary table as your data set.
                                    - ORMs are needed because OOP languages are organized around graphs, but SQL wants to only return tables
                                      "to map graph to a talbe"
                                    - Ternary relationship & Attributed relationships distinquish SQL from OOP

Years of experience has taught me that almost every time someone swears up and down that two tables are one-to-many they end up changing it to many-to-many a week later and have to redesign the whole database. Just save yourself the trouble and really justify one-to-many and declare it permanent if it's really true.
                                                - Find any many-to-many relationships that seem to involve the same table and see if maybe that table should be an "attributed relation". I'll cover this later, but the idea is that the table is used to relate many other tables and also has a few attributes on it as well. Once you identify this you can simplify the design by using this one table as a single connector for all of them.
                                                - Look for any three tables that have "triangle" connections that seem to always exist, and consider making a single "ternary relation". A ternary relation is a single table that connects three other tables together, with the idea being that these three tables can only be connected all at once or not at all.
                                        - atomize
                                          "Break out each concept into its attributes and parts; name relation table1_table2"
                                        - reduce
                                          "Get rid of anything you don't actually need. It's easy to add later, harder to remove;"
                                        - normalize
                                          "Move duplication around to improve consistency and reduce repetition."
                                        - denormalize
                                          "Denormalize tables if you must."
                                    - Implementing with SQL
                                        - Create all the tables and just their primary key ids. No other attributes. Get that working.
                                        - Now create all the relation tables, sticking to the convention of TABLE_TABLE for each of them. Use columns named TABLE_idfor each of the relation tables columns. For example, I have a person_pet relation table, with the columns person_id andpet_id.
                                        - Once you have this basic structure working, create a set of test queries that exercise each relation you've written down in your table of how tables are related. Take the time to cover as much of the connections as possible while you can shape the database.
                                        - After you get the relations solid, you go back through and add all the other attributes as columns and then rerun your sample queries to make sure they still work. If you've done everything right your queries will keep working after you add the attributes. If they break then your attributes need to be redesigned or corrected.
                                        - Finally, write some sample queries and data to test out that it works correctly.
                                    - Implementing with ORM
                                        - Create all the classes for your model and make sure it generates the right tables and only the ids.
                                        - Add all the relationships to the classes you've made.
                                        - Write unit tests for the basic relationships and make sure they make sense.
                                        - Add the attributes and make sure the unit tests keep working as expected. Remember your attributes shouldn't break any of your relations.
                                        - Finally, write higher level unit tests that validate the attributes and queries for them.
                                    - Exercise:
                                        - Design a database for a veterinary management system, or pick some system you want to build and design a database for it. Create the screens for it after and compare it to your database design. Keep it small.
                                        - Go draw up screens for a food delivery service, or something else you want to build. Again keep it small, nothing massive, but do the screens first. Now go and design the database using the screens to guide you.
                                        - Evaluate the two approaches and see which one you liked better or which one made the best results for both UI and database design.

                                - go with gradual gradients instead of extreme/sharp colors
                                - Google font and iconfinder ( font pairings) -  go with vector icons 
                                  "http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Ubuntu#pairings"
                                - use percentages for padding/margin, rather than absolute px
                                - use lorem impsum and placehold.it 
                                - if you use padding, don't pad horizontally as this will often mess up the grid.
                                - use .row-fluid & .container combo 
                                  "You can use row-fluid inside a container to get a 12-column (nestable) fluid grid within a pseudo-fixed-width, centred container that steps down in size as the window resizes. This is the best way to achieve a resizable layout."

                      startup: app idea: start with a basic workflo/productivty app, with functionalities as note saving a la workflowy (gitversioned controlled or graph like depending on preference) ; user based on their usage path such as: writer, engineer, manager, students et cetera can upgrade it with such subjectively enhanced ‘modules’. Writers will be based on a TSWriter oppinionated project. Include premium screencast and advice based on using these oppinionated modules. Also people can also include their personal ‘grunt/automation/setup.sh-like modules’ for uploading tumblr post, to facebook … et cetera a la ifttt.com . Another Writer Module addition could be Markdown writing with autogenerated blogpost. Additionally functionality of the starter (productivity/workflowy app) will be pomodorro(default task system, other modules for common agile methods like SCRUM for Software Devs / managing softwares integration). First develop it for the person, 1 indivual, in question and then upgrade it into a collaborative corporate software (a la Atlassion Software suites?). Focus on OpenSource for the basic app and additional functionalities as paid software upgrades. Functionalities shop (a la EverNote competitor?). Another component will be its android like, to the core customization possibility, hire any developer to customize the platform for you ( a la Wordpress opensourced business model, researhc!). A subset pomodoro cusotmization might be my  notes on #TheAdvisor & #BigIdea and workflowy customizations #workflowyClone . Another might be a HipChat like interface(or integration via API) but start out with my 1 man purposeful execution/activity logging incoporate in  Pomodorro(Subjective) Module by Dijon Kock(a sort a la 280daily realtime daily journal). Another Pomodorro module integration might be breakpassing - meditiation and music ( calm.com, raining.fm, coffitivity, 8tracks study/work playlists). An automator script might be: automated executionlog sumamry blogpost(simple bulletlist of primary accomplishments and starred things that day) - having the entire world (or company blogs) be able to see what you produce is a real motivator! being Reasoning/Competitor(evernote) distinquisher: Evernote isn’t for the wild, its not organized in a particular style, everyone has a particular style, generally there is a common style you could accept as a starting point and grow it as you wish (feature requests). That is the motivation behind <MyAppName>.  Another starter’s upgrade/inclusion could be google chrome history/bookmarks/Pocket-readlater integration(auto deciding to include in current pomodoro project time when your google that page and it pops up as a questioning to include in your realtime execution journal loggin, also include warnings or a mean nudge if you directing to a social network). Future perspective: Include #DisocverDotNet integration of this personal opensource (future collaborative) productivity/worflowy : its a Crazy Wild Mind Chaos Mollifier; in web community setting, responsive mobile first UX/UI design. A Student module/upgrade might include a feature for ANKI/SuperMEMO/DuolingoLike memory retention techniques and workflows integrated as a routine(grunted) in your personal app ecosystem ( like android shareable through other modules and automations etc, see Android Is Better article - ” Android intents let apps to interact with each other and share data. ” ).
                      
                      Make a Chrome App version? SO that another functionality could be on making annotated comments (a la medium.com) per article i deem worthy enough. "

                    - Closures
                      "combo of function object and its scope at definition"
                        - lexical scoping : functions execute wusing variable scope when defined (not invoked)
                        - understand the scope chain : chain of 'objects' that define variables in scope, nested functions are redefined each time outer function invoked and therefore different scope chain each time
                        - technically all JS functions are CLosures
                          "doesnt matter that its a closures when scope chain at invocation same as when defined"
                        - nested function closures : functions invoked with different scope chain than when defined
                        -  nature of closures: they capture the local variable (and parameter) bindings of the outer function within which they are defined
                        - implementation example:
                          "var uniqueInteger = (function() { // Define and invoke
                          					var counter = 0; // Private state of function below
                          					return function() { return counter++; };
                          				}());//nested function object returned to uniqueInt and therefore
                          				//exclusive access to vars in scope"
                        - create a enclosed environment with exclusive variable bindings
                        - more than 1 nested function can be defined within the same outer function and share the same scope chain , ex:
                          "function counter() {
                          	var n = 0;
                          	return {
                          		count: function() { return n++; },
                          		reset: function() { n = 0; }
                          	};
                          }
                          var c = counter(), d = counter(); // Create two counters
                          c.count() // => 0
                          d.count() // => 0: they count independently
                          c.reset() // reset() and count() methods share state
                          c.count() // => 0: because we reset c
                          d.count() // => 1: d was not reset
                          
                          EACH invocation of counter() creates a new  scope chain and a new private variable"
                        - use closures for private state, combo getters and setters ex:
                          "function counter(n) { // Function argument n is the private variable
                          	return {
                          			// Property getter method returns and increments private counter var.
                          			get count() { return n++; },
                          
                          			// Property setter doesn't allow the value of n to decrease
                          			set count(m) {
                          				if (m >= n) n = m;
                          				else throw Error("count can only be set to a larger value");
                          			}
                          	};
                          }
                          
                          var c = counter(1000);
                          c.count // => 1000
                          c.count // => 1001
                          c.count = 2000
                          c.count // => 2000
                          c.count = 2000 // => Error!
                          
                          NOTE no declaration of local var, uses parameter 'n' to hold the private state shared by the property accessor methods"
                        - shared private state through closures, ex:
                          "Example 8-4. Private property accessor methods using closures

                        - mix data representation and problem-specific code in one object, it is a good idea to try and put the data representation code into a separate type of object
                        - start from bottom then keep adding different layers

                        -  simply by ordering <script> tags in HTML
                        - Variant 1: separate file with info about dependencies
                        - (no script tag) fetch content of file directly and then use eval func

                    - Module
                        - interface can vary depending on the module
                        - collection-of-functions modules interface is all simply the funcs
                        - modules should not use not use toplevel variables for values that are not part of their external interface
                        - window object and toplevel vars
                          "solving name-space pollution; see gist"
                            - work around: write all the code for the module inside a function, and then finally add the variables that are part of the module's interface to the window object
                            - Problem 1: function still a toplevel var not part of modules interf
                              "solve: making the module function anonymous and calling it directly, function() "

                              "using a "provide" helper function that given an object containing the values that must be exported into the window object"
                            - I do not recommend writing modules like this right from the start. While you are still working on a piece of code, it is easier to just use the simple approach we have used so far, and put everything at top level. That way, you can inspect the module's internal values in your browser, and test them out. Once a module is more or less finished, it is not difficult to wrap it in a function.
                            - problem: Module provides too many variables to be put in top-level environment
                              "solve: similar to Math object ; model as single object -> properties are functions and values it exports"

If you have more than 9 parentheses parts in your pattern, this will no longer work."
                            - When the second argument given to the replace method is a function value instead of a string, this function is called every time a match is found, and the matched text is replaced by whatever the function returns. The arguments given to the function are the matched elements, similar to the values found in the arrays returned by match: The first one is the whole match, and after that comes one argument for every parenthesized part of the pattern.

                                      * TOC.js: create a table of contents for a document.
                                      *
                                      * This module registers an anonymous function that runs automatically
                                      * when the document finishes loading. When it runs, the function first
                                      * looks for a document element with an id of "TOC". If there is no
                                      * such element it creates one at the start of the document.
                                      *
                                      * Next, the function finds all <h1> through <h6> tags, treats them as
                                      * section titles, and creates a table of contents within the TOC
                                      * element. The function adds section numbers to each section heading
                                      * and wraps the headings in named anchors so that the TOC can link to
                                      * them. The generated anchors have names that begin with "TOC", so
                                      * you should avoid this prefix in your own HTML.
                                      *
                                      * The entries in the generated TOC can be styled with CSS. All entries have
                                      * a class "TOCEntry". Entries also have a class that corresponds to the level
                                      * of the section heading. <h1> tags generate entries of class "TOCLevel1",
                                      * <h2> tags generate entries of class "TOCLevel2", and so on. Section numbers
                                      * inserted into headings have class "TOCSectNum".
                                      *
                                      * You might use this module with a stylesheet like this:
                                      *
                                      * # TOC { border: solid black 1px; margin: 10px; padding: 10px; }
                                      * .TOCEntry { font-family: sans-serif; }
                                      * .TOCEntry a { text-decoration: none; }
                                      * .TOCLevel1 { font-size: 16pt; font-weight: bold; }
                                      * .TOCLevel2 { font-size: 12pt; margin-left: .5in; }
                                      * .TOCSectNum:after { content: ": "; }
                                      *
                                      * That final line generates a colon and space after section numbers. To hide
                                      * the section numbers, use this:
                                      *
                                      * .TOCSectNum { display: none }
                                      *

                                    - Whenever an event occurs, the handler for that event, if any, is called
                                    - every event creates an object
                                    - browser JavaScript is single-threaded, there are never two 'threads' running at the same time

                                    - event, when not handled, can 'bubble' through the DOM tree until its reaches a handler else browser handles it

                          "...When a file is just a file, it is always the same, but when there is a program that builds it every time it is requested, it could be made to look different for each person, based on things like whether this person has logged in or specified certain preferences. This can also make managing the content of web-pages much easier ― instead of adding a new HTML file whenever something new is put on a website, a new document is added to some central storage, and the program knows where to find it and how to show it to clients."

                        - Some websites make use of intensive communication between the programs running on the client and the programs running on the server. For such systems, it can be practical to think of some HTTP requests as calls to functions that run on the server. The client makes request to URLs that identify the functions, giving the arguments as URL parameters or POST data. The server then calls the function, and puts the result into JSON or XML document that it sends back. If you write a few convenient support functions, this can make calling server-side functions almost as easy as calling client-side ones... except, of course, that you do not get their results instantly.

                          "organize later"
                            - with Node.js, we not only implement our application, we also implement the whole HTTP server
                            - have a main file which calls code modularly , use modular organization
                            - anonymous function :  pass a function as a parameter to another function in-place
                            - Event-driven asynchronous callbacks
                                - problem:
                                  "var result = database.query("SELECT * FROM hugetable");
                                  console.log("Hello World");
                                  //code was synchronous: first do the database query, and only when this is done, then write to the console"
                                - execution model of Node.js is different - there is only one single process. If there is a slow database query somewhere in this process, this affects the whole process - everything comes to a halt until the slow query has finished.
                                  "avoid this, JavaScript, and therefore Node.js, introduces the concept of event-driven, asynchronous callbacks, by utilizing an event loop"
                                - refactored:
                                  "database.query("SELECT * FROM hugetable", function(rows) {
                                    var result = rows;
                                  });
                                  console.log("Hello World")
                                  
                                  //instead of expecting database.query() to directly return a result to us, we pass it a second parameter, an anonymous function"
                                - "It's important to note that this asynchronous, single-threaded, event-driven execution model isn't an infinitely scalable performance unicorn with silver bullets attached. It is just one of several models, and it has its limitations, one being that as of now, Node.js is just one single process, and it can run on only one single CPU core. Personally, I find this model quite approachable, because it allows to write applications that have to deal with concurrency in an efficient and relatively straightforward manner."
                                - nodejs enters the event loop - continuously cycles through this loop again and again whenever there is nothing else to do, waiting for events.

                                - making a module means exporting those parts of its functionality that we want to provide to scripts that require our module
                                - export functions from a module by adding with desired 'function' : exports.function = function
                                - use our server module just like any internal module: by requiring its file and assigning it to a variable, its exported functions become available to us
                            - Routing : making different HTTP requests point at different parts of our code
                            - Functional programming concept : passing functions as arguments
                            - Making request handlers respond in a straightforward approach of return() content they want to display to the user, and send this response data in teh onRequest function back to the user is problematic , why?
                              "if the request handlers wants to make use of non-blocking operation in the future, the information retrieved after the operation is done (in the background, which the event loop keeps checking on) will never be 'returned' into the content the user receives"
                            - BLocking and Non-blocking 
                                - blocking simulation using a sleep(), this goes in our 'start requesthandler', it slows server down by 10 seconds, and also even when requesting 'upload' - a blocking operation!
                                  "function sleep(miliSecs) {
                                  	var startTime = new Date().getTime();
                                  	while (new Date().getTime()< startTime + miliSecs);

At this point, content is still “empty”, due to the fact that the callback function passed to exec() has not yet been called - because exec() operates asynchronous
                                    - we may assume that the callback function we passed into exec() will be called only when the “find /” command has finished running.

                                - You dont need nouns, you need verbs.
                            - Understanding Node.js - Your code is King and Node his army of servants. Life is good, for the king's servants carry out all of his tasks in parallel, but only report with one result at a time, so the king can focus. 
                              "http://debuggable.com/posts/understanding-node-js"
                                - Your code gives node the two tasks to read and write a file, and then goes to sleep. Once node has completed a task, the callback for it is fired. But there can only be one callback firing at the same time. Until that callback has finished executing, all other callbacks have to wait in line. In addition to that, there is no guarantee on the order in which the callbacks will fire.
                                  "var fs = require('fs')

                                  "You got it! That's the entire beauty of JavaScripts single-threaded / event loop design!"
                                - In a web application, your main response time cost is usually the sum of time it takes to execute all your database queries. With node, you can execute all your queries at once, reducing the response time to the duration it takes to execute the slowest query.
                                - Are low response times / high concurrency important? Node is really good at that.
                                - How big is the project? Small projects should be fine. Big projects should evaluate carefully (available libraries, resources to fix a bug or two upstream, etc.).

You can even map returned methods and properties to those within the module code—this is where the beautiful organization of the module pattern really shines.
                                    - API methods and properties will be available through the object returned from the plugin initialization.

                      "My endless attempt at self-study hasn't worked out quite how i'd hope. The College curriculum isn't working out too well either. Been trying for months now, no real progress. I want to secure my future. I have too many 'startup' projects/apps i want to get at but i constantly feel like im lacking the knowledge and being constrained. I dont like to be constrained so i want to start at it. I need a vacation. An intensive guided/apprenticeship / project based learning program is my kind of vacation. Generation ADHD ( not clinically, but pretty damn hyper at times). "
                    - What kinds of things have you tried to do already to learn to program? What resources did you use?
                      "Udacity CS101 course; beginners introduction to programming using python. University course introduction to programming using Java. A few programming books ( currently online hypertext Eloquent Javascript). Ive completed some Codecademy courses. Recently tried but didn't follow through with Coursera/PrincetonUniv offering of Algorithms, Part 1. "
                    - Tell us something programming or web development related that you feel competent in and something that you find difficult or beyond your current ability.
                      "I feel competent in my ability to code but not development. I feel confident i can my 'algorithmic' thinking ability exist but i struggle between theory and the gratifying practical applications. I tried to keep up to date on trends in the development scene of web dev, regularly lurking on hackersnews, and obsessively starring opensource projects on github. I feel im stuck as a able to concentrate and stick it out; lacking that perseverance issue related to being hyperactive and moody."

                    - The enterprise software landscape underwent a massive shift as former rivals set aside their differences and joined hands (*stacks) to offer customers a better way to purchase, deploy and manage their enterprise applications and infrastructure. It’s exciting to see the enterprise leaders commit to building a more open ecosystem of best-of-breed solutions that give customers what they want – technology innovation – in an integrated approach.

In order to accomplish that task, marketing needs systems in place for data collection, automated analysis and targeted distribution –each of which increasingly depends on IT expertise, particularly as campaigns become more and more centered on customer insight and real-time analytics."

                    -  Hello, ik ben Dijon! First impression is the most important! Dus hopelijk zal deze motivatie motiverend zijn. Here it goes: ik ben een 20 jarige jonge man uit Aruba. Ik woon sinds vorig jaar september in Nederland. Ik ga volgend school jaar beginnen met International Business Administration bij Erasmus. Vandaar zou je kunnen raden dat ik voornamelijk Engels spreek. En dat is zo. Ik spreek thuis Engels met mijn ouders en familie. En vandaar ook dat ik hier nu effe hard gebruikt maakt van google translate! Haha nee, niet echt zo veel meer, mijn Nederlands is een stuk vooruit gegaan sinds ik all enkele maanden hier in Nederland woon. Ik ben voor de rest een aardige, netjes,  rustig maar ook actief en hyper, georganiseerde persoon die gezellig ben en grapjes maakt maar wel serieus ben tijdens studie en serieuze onderwerpen als ik die tegenkom. Ik ben ook iemand van veel interesse en veel energie! Ik hou van art. Ik speel tennis en allerlei sport. Ik hou van feest ( maar niet elke weekend) maar als ik feest dan feest ik hard! Study hard party harder?  Ik hou ook van koken e healthy eating.  En ja voor de rest zou ik zeggen dat ik echt chill, rustig, actief en openminded ben. En ben altijd benieuwd om nieuwe mensen te leren kennen!

                  "Ik ben Dijon en ik will graag bij jullie werken. Deze komende jaar studeer ik bedrijfskunde in Rotterdam en momenteel ben ik aan het verhuizen. Ik heb geen zomer vakantie plans en will dus hard aan het werk gaan om een beetje bij te verdienen voordat mijn school begint. Ik zal misschien ook verder een parttime werk willben doen naast mijn studie maar eerst lijk mijn een proef bij zomberbaan bij jullie en goeie begin. Ik will bij jullie werken omdat ik echt veel houd van koken. Het koken is een van mijn leukste hobbies waar ik van lekker vers eten kan genieten. Ik ben zo een healthy, real food, eater en hou dus ook van elke keer nieuwe recepten proberen. Ik zou het dus een leuke uitdaging vinden om bij La Place te werken waar ik dagelijks vers eten kan bereiden en hopelijk meer leert over koken en de horeca sector. Doordat La Place ook zo een groot nationale bedrijf is zal ervaring bij jullie waardevol zijn voor mijn carriere, en dat vindt ik belangerijk. Ik ben een hard werker en zou mijn best doen om kwaliteitsvole resultaten op tijd te leveren. "

                    - Eigenschappen van Mij
                      "Ik ben heel enthousiast voor nieuwe 'challenges' uitdagingen; 1ste week/maand teamleiders/management vragen hoe het is bij de filiaal om door te groeien tot hogere positie, waarom so vroeg want als ik iet do moet ik het goed doen en strijven naar een hogere positie is een manier om mijnzelf te motiveren om hard te werken elke werkdag. Ik begin elke werkdag met veel energy en probeer mijn uiterste best te doen door niet alleen mijn taak te doen maar als ik iets out of place ziet ik de management laat weten en goed communicatie met hun. Ik probeer elke werkdag een 'review' van de management te krijgen hoe ik gedaan heb en wat ik beter zou kunnen doen volgende keer. Ik neem initiaf als nodig is waar er een situatie tijdens werk is die niemand weet wat te doen, pak ik aan om snel oplossing te vinden. Tijdens winkelopentijd doe ik mijn werk maar tegenlijkertijd ben ik altijd 'smiling' met de mentaliteit van customer first and probeer als ik gevragen wordt iederen te hulpen en als ik iets nieet weet zeg ik ze excuse mij maar ik weet het niet maar ik kan wel even snel voor u gaan kijken. Dan ga ik bij de teamleider of meer expierneced medewerker antwoord vragen. Take initiatief. Extra hard werken en probeer uit te steken. Team members motiveren. Gezellige sfeer maar altijd concentreet op het werk. Leeuk doen maar altijd in de grens efficiency. Sorry dat mijn nederlands misschien niet perfect is; ik ben engelstalig. Goede communicatie met medewerkers. Goeie sfeer mits productivieteit hoog is. Ik ben een productiviteit junkie vrije tijd alles organiseert goed in order, systematisch met school en alles wat ik doe, makkelijk die houding modificeren voor een leidership positie. Die character neem ik mee en streef ik naar (*use management terms - review greys anatomy board meeting talk about fincance, customer retention, etc)"

Het is een uitdaging voor mij altijd om op schema of zelfs eerder alle producte  vullen en netjes spiegelen. Ik heb nu 1 jaar 's avonds bij Albert Hein ( Woensele Markt te Eindhiven). Ik heb daar snel geleerd hoe de winkel in elkaar werkt en van alleen maar vakken vuller tot vracht verlossen en magazijn splitsen  van producten.  Ik neem vind het  interesant en neem initiatief om nieuwe aspecten van een bedrijf te leren kennen.  Ik begrijp en pass toe een klantengericht houding , altijd klaar om hulp te verlenen aan de klanten met een vriendelijke glimlach. De reden die ik voornamelijk bij Marqt will werken is dat ik zelfs gezond, vers, duurzam en echt eet! Helemaal eens met jullie gedachten.

                        - structure for data parsing #theAdvisor 
                        - the idea is you want an overview of things, that is generated from your notes that you can use as a task, TASKS generated based on tags and basically is a copy of  your notes layout #improveWofly
                        - Before start into a project create a quick little outline overview (one which you iteratively adjust and adapt obviously)
                        - you have a time line in teh shape of a funnel, for the things far away you have more time and less subsections, as thigns get closer to timeline #theAdvisor(moves them dynamically with time) you end op reviewing them and creating smaller entities from these to to micromanage

                        - #theAdvisorReviewer track how long things are queued in a certain #timeline 
                        - use #timeline to determine randomly determine when to read which topic but also option to chose which topic interesting you at a certain time and it provides you with matching topics that are in that current timeline
                        - provided parameters are timeline so i want to read this next month, having a set of rules like max recommendation per timeframe the app creates these recommendations on a daily, weekly, monthly basis constantly givving you a overview of what you will be doing these coming days but you only find out on the day what definitely it ends up recomending, however you can add what you want to do then too so you can overide to say i wanna do this today, it collect and stores user behevaior and what you liked to study at what time of the day (review practives by knewton) for later AI analyzation but for now just amass the content and store it
                        - gets data from workflowy -> code a WORKFLOWY PARSER
                        - incorperate AGILE practices for personal review cycles and ability to share my reviewing with the community who uses the Advisor

                        - summaries and source are put into a que which is sent into the content staging area in teh #gitVersion  where after a sufficient level of expertise has been reached with the topic one can then review the qeued summaries of cotent sources and actually create a blogpost, this happens when minimun 80% #topicKnowledge has beengained, which is a property of TOPIC 
                        - EACH TOPIC also has different subtopics and each subtopic also has #topicKnowledge  levels and properties and also one can be shown related topics upon blog posting by #theAdvisor  so that you can see the broader application of the topic in other fields #DiscoverDotNet  part of the discoverDotNEt framework of thinking and content exploration , of the disocver net not only would you get similar topics by tag shown but also human chosen  #DDNInterestingConnection attributes

                        - Getting Things Done (popular one?) by David Allen
                    - Rules
                        - 1 pomodoro: 30 min activity sessions with coffitivity/studyplaylist
                        - 3-5 min break after each pomodoro: grab a drink, fb, breathe/calm.com 
                        - Once a POMODORO Begins, it HAS to RING
                        - tracking pomodoros until task is complete
                        - 15-30 min break after ever 4 poms: meditate, take a walk, nothing complex
                        - extra time over for taks? -> overlearn / review / improve
                        - if task = 5+ poms -> microtask it or split it
                        - mark interuptions - dependency inversion mechanism - x pomodoro a day
                        - Qualitative Estimation Errors in Planning based on interuptions (during Recording & Planning)
                        - add deadlines to root task/project if needed? (seperate Tasks Colllection)
                        - OBJECTIVES
                            - 1 How much effort per activity?
                            - 2 Cut down on interuptions
                            - 3 Estimate/predict effort for activities
                                - If It Takes More Than 5-7 Pomodoros, Break It Down
                                - If It Takes Less Than One Pomodoro, Add It Up
                                - Record estimate pomodoros for a day and match activities to them
                            - Make the Pomoro more effective ( later) 
                            - Timetable
                            - keeping tracking complexity to a minimum
                    - Guidelined THoughts
                        - Simply work, track, observe, and change in order to improve, if need be.
                        - Stimulating the value of continuity leads to productivity and creativity. Every tick of the Pomodoro, if you hear it, is an invitation to stay focused, alert, and to continue.
                        - The final objective is to get to the 30minute mark having worked continuously, with no interruptions
                        - The Pomodoro Technique allows you to keep your focus on the current Pomodoro, or once that’s done, on the next Pomodoro.
                        - without having to worry about  every  thing. One Pomodoro at a time, one activity at a time, one objective at a time.
                        - The key objective is never to recover lost time, but instead to be focused on taking the next step on your chosen path, which you often - consciously - change
                        - After writing off an internal interruption as unplanned mind is quickly freed from that thought and you can go ahead with your current task and focus back more easily~personal review
                        - Stopping, detaching, and observing yourself from the outside enhances awareness of your behavior.

            - Letter to my Daughter/Son
              "Dear Cutie-Pie,
              
              Recently, your mother and I were searching for an answer on Google. Halfway through entering the question, Google returned a list of the most popular searches in the world. Perched at the top of the list was “How to keep him interested.”
              
              It startled me. I scanned several of the countless articles about how to be sexy and sexual, when to bring him a beer versus a sandwich, and the ways to make him feel smart and superior.
              
              And I got angry.
              
              Little One, it is not, has never been, and never will be your job to “keep him interested.”
              
              Little One, your only task is to know deeply in your soul—in that unshakeable place that isn’t rattled by rejection and loss and ego—that you are worthy of interest. (If you can remember that everyone else is worthy of interest also, the battle of your life will be mostly won. But that is a letter for another day.)
              
              If you can trust your worth in this way, you will be attractive in the most important sense of the word: you will attract a boy who is both capable of interest and who wants to spend his one life investing all of his interest in you.
              
              Little One, I want to tell you about the boy who doesn’t need to be keptinterested, because he knows you are interesting:
              
              I don’t care if he puts his elbows on the dinner table—as long as he puts his eyes on the way your nose scrunches when you smile. And then can’t stop looking.
              
              I don’t care if he can’t play a bit of golf with me—as long as he can play with the children you give him and revel in all the glorious and frustrating ways they are just like you.
              
              I don’t care if he doesn’t follow his wallet—as long as he follows his heart and it always leads him back to you.
              
              I don’t care if he is strong—as long as he gives you the space to exercise the strength that is in your heart.
              
              I couldn’t care less how he votes—as long as he wakes up every morning and daily elects you to a place of honor in your home and a place of reverence in his heart.
              
              I don’t care about the color of his skin—as long as he paints the canvas of your lives with brushstrokes of patience, and sacrifice, and vulnerability, and tenderness.
              
              I don’t care if he was raised in this religion or that religion or no religion—as long as he was raised to value the sacred and to know every moment of life, and every moment of life with you, is deeply sacred.
              
              In the end, Little One, if you stumble across a man like that and he and I have nothing else in common, we will have the most important thing in common:
              
              You.
              
              Because in the end, Little One, the only thing you should have to do to “keep him interested” is to be you.
              
              Your eternally interested guy,
              
              Daddy"

                                - heap property: If A is a parent node of B then key(A) is ordered with respect to key(B) with the same ordering applying across the heap. Either the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node (this kind of heap is called max heap) or the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children and the least key is in the root node (min heap). Heaps are crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, and in the sorting algorithm heapsort.
                            - binary tree
                                - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
                                - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
                                - The left and right subtree must each also be a binary search tree.
                                - There must be no duplicate nodes.

                                - sentiment of a tweet is equivalent to the sum of the sentiment scores for each term in the tweet

                            - We know we can use certain words to deduce the sentiment of a tweet. Once you know the sentiment of the tweets that contain some term, you can assign a sentiment to the term itself.

                            - Notes
                                - The point of this blogpost isnt providing you guys with the solution it is primarily for me to empirically review the problems and solution. By trying to explain my reasoning explicitly i attack those holes in my understanding /places where i simply assume a given. With this ill be able to pin them them, analyze them, figure it out, review it and get a better mental picture, visual aids included! :D A lot of times you think you understand something and you really dont until you try and explain it.

                                        - take intersection of terms for docid1 and docid2 
                                        - Form a row for counts of these terms for docid1 and another row for counts of these terms for docid2.
                                        - Multiply row*row' to get the answer.
                                    - Solution C

                                        - view VT -> select term, docid, count from frequency where docid = <first one> or <second one>
                                        - V*VT gives 4 rows and 3 colms (docid1, docid2, sum(count1*count2). I take <docid1, docid2, sum_count>

                                        - solve this you just only have to get a number. That number can be seen as the dot product of the two document vectors/rows corresponding to the two documents '10080_txt_crude' and '17035_txt_earn'.

                                - I used an inner join to the same table and limited the documents to the two in question and also specified where they had common terms. Also summed the multiplied counts from both tables and submitted the number returned.

                                    - Here's what I did
                                    - 1. I did not create any views but used aliases to create 2 datasets A and B from same table
                                    - 2. Joined them on term and created N rows only where terms are matching with count being (A.count*B.count)
                                    - 3. Summed up the counts to 1 row
                                    - 4. This gives me a number X

                                    - But notice that you don't need to compute the similarity of both (doc1, doc2) and (doc2, doc1) -- they are the same, since similarity is symmetric

                                    - What are cells? A cell in a matrix is a value that is at the intersection of a row and a col so a matrix of 2x2 will have four cells each cell is represented by a single record in a table. So a 2x2 matrix will have 4 records in a DB table
