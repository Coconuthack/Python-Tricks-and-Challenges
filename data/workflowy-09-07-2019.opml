                <outline text="JS inter to ad version 1" _note="Learn Intermediate and Advanced JavaScript February25This Year&#10;(Learn Intermediate and Advanced JavaScript From Some of The Best JavaScript Minds)&#10;NOTICE: This article will be updated in 2 days, so it would be best to come back on March 1 to read the final version. I will likely change some of the recommended books, in addition to some of the content. Don’t purchase any of the books just yet, besides the Effective JavaScript book. That book will definitely be in the final version of the article.&#10;Prerequisite:&#10;You have completed this course: Learn JavaScript Properly (For NON-JavaScript programmers and First-time Programmers)&#10;&#10;Or you already know the following JavaScript concepts well:&#10;— Simple Data Types, Reference Types, Operators, and Objects (in Detail)&#10;— Variable Scope and Hoisting, Expressions, and Statements&#10;— The DOM, The Window Object, and JavaScript Events&#10;— Functions, Function Properties, and Function Expression&#10;&#10;Duration:&#10;3 Easygoing Weeks&#10;Topics in This Post&#10; What Topics Comprise Intermediate and Advanced JavaScript?&#10; Why Should I Learn Advanced JavaScript?&#10; Resources For This Course&#10; Get WebStorm, If You Don’t Have It&#10; Week 1 (Essential JavaScript Tips and Techniques)&#10; Week 2 (Complete JavaScript Ninja Training)&#10; Week 3 (Adv. Functions, Design Patterns, And More)&#10; Further Reading&#10; Final Words&#10;&#10;This article provides you with a rigorous roadmap on how to learn advanced JavaScript. The skills you will learn in this course of study will free you from the constrains of using the limited JS techniques you have been using to develop JS applications, and they will give you new insights and new techniques to program JS applications more efficiently, more precisely, and more optimally.&#10;If you are new to JavaScript and you are an experienced programmer in another langauge such as Java, Python, ActionScript, Rails, PHP, etc., it is important that you learn JavaScript properly. JavaScript has many idiosyncracies and uncommon concepts that you must know well before you follow this Intermediate to Advanced JavaScript course.&#10;&#10;What Topics Comprise Intermediate and Advanced JavaScript?&#10;Intermediate and Advanced JavaScript topics include:&#10;— Debugging JS code, Object-oriented JavaScript&#10;— Advanced Functions: Callback functions, Bind, Currying, Higher-order functions,&#10;— Asynchronous execution, timers,&#10;— JavaScript Patterns for&#10;— And more (will be updated in a day or 2).&#10;&#10;Why Should I Learn Advanced JavaScript?&#10;If you work as a font-end developer or you plan to develop JavaScript applications, libraries, or frameworks, it is essential that you understand the aforementioned advanced JavaScript topics, because you will not be able to develop complex JavaScript applications without knowing them.&#10;&#10;And more (will be updated in a day or 2).&#10;&#10;Resources For This Course&#10;NOTE: This section will be updated in a day or 2, so don’t buy any books just yet.&#10;&#10;We are using 3 books; fear not: all three of the books are short reads. So the reading is relatively light; we can carry on with our weekly customs as we study advanced JavaScript in 3 weeks. Here are the books we are using (the 3 books will cost just over $60):&#10;&#10;Effective JavaScript: 68 Specific Ways to Harness the Power of JavaScript—My Favorite JavaScript book.&#10;JavaScript Patterns&#10;Secrets of The JavaScript Ninja&#10;Buy the “Effective JavaScript” eBook at this link with a 45% off coupon code, and you will get it in 3 formats: .mobi, .pdf, and .epub.&#10;Here is the 45% off discount code (the book will cost less than $18.00):&#10;IUGD45 (45%)&#10;&#10;The Roadmap to Advanced JavaScript&#10;You will learn just about all the JavaScript advanced techniques and details about JavaScript’s most important concepts that you will use often as a JavaScript Developer.&#10;&#10;If you don’t have enough time to commit to read the books in 3 weeks, try to do it in no more than 6 weeks. The longer you take, the harder it will be for you to grasp and remember everything you will learn.&#10;&#10;Get WebStorm, If You Don’t Have It&#10;If you plan to be a JavaScript developer or use JavaScript often, you should take a break now and download a trial copy of WebStorm.&#10;&#10;It is unquestionably the best editor (IDE) for programming JavaScript. It costs $49.00 when your 30-day trial period expires, but it is probably the best investment you will make as a JavaScript developer, besides buying the books you are using in this course and learning advanced JavaScript.&#10;Make sure you set WebStorm to use JSHint. JSHint is “tool to detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code and to enforce your team’s coding conventions.”[1].&#10;Moreover, WebStorm is a world-class, professional-grade IDE for coding professional JavaScript web applications, so you will use it a lot. And it integrates Node.js, Git, and other JavaScript frameworks, so even after you have become a rock star JavaScript developer, you will be using it, unless a more compelling JavaScript IDE comes out in the next few months.&#10;It is fair that I also mention Sublime Text 2, which is the next best JavaScript editor. But it is not as feature rich and complete (even with numerous add-on packages) as WebStorm. I use Sublime Text 2 to make small edits to files of different programming languages, including JS files. But I don’t use it to program full JavaScript web applications.&#10;Week 1 (Essential JavaScript Tips and Techniques)&#10;Read the entire Effective JavaScript book.&#10;This is my favorite JavaScript book. Every page is packed with incredible tips and insightful techniques. I kept whispering, “A Ha,” on many pages.&#10;Week 2 (Complete JavaScript Ninja Training)&#10;Read the entire Secrets of The JavaScript Ninja book.&#10;Week 3 (Adv. Functions, Design Patterns, And More)&#10;I have not read this particular book, but the topics seems ideal for this intermediate to advanced JavaScript roadmap. I do plan to read it, though. It is neither a dense nor a long read, so you can read the entire book in one week. Read the entire JavaScript Patterns book.&#10;This is optional: Since there are a few hours to spare in this week, you should have enough time to watch Douglas Crockford’s Advanced JavaScript Videos.&#10;Further Reading&#10;The following books provide additional advanced topics that you must know well if you do indeed want to be a an advanced JavaScript developer. Why come 90% of way, take it home the last 10% with the following books.&#10;&#10;High Performance JavaScript (Build Faster Web Application Interfaces)&#10;Test-Driven JavaScript Development&#10;Final Words&#10;JavaScript is a fun and lovable programming language, and with it, you will be able to quickly develop sophisticated web applications that hundreds of millions of users can use within hours of completion. There is much satisfaction from being a JavaScript developer, and indeed much pleasure. Share some of your newly acquired advanced JavaScript skills with others and be a good steward for advancing the web and creating applications that users love.&#10;&#10;To become an advanced JS programmer you need a combination of real-world programming experience at all levels and in various forms (developing disparate applications with myriad technologies, libraries and frameworks), and implementation of the advanced techniques learned. So it is imperative that you put the skills and techniques you have learned from this course into practice—when you are developing web applications.&#10;&#10;Have fun developing and keep coming back, for there is still much for you to learn on JavaScriptIsSexy.com  " />

                    <outline text="&quot;I keep getting mixed reviews about the LCCs. But one reason I always shied away from Ryanair in particular (and I'm surprised the article doesn't mention this) is that - at least in their early days - they would fly to airports way outside the city limits, such that their passengers would still have lengthy taxi or train rides to get to their ultimate destinations. Economically of course, this made perfect sense, since landing and other fees at such airports would typically be much lower. But those savings would usually be Ryanair's, not the passenger's; whatever I'd save on an air fare, I might lose to a taxi driver, or I'd get to my ultimate destination much later than I would like.&quot;" />

                    <outline text="&quot;The full-service airlines, their businesses devastated by low-cost competition, have filed complaints against Ryanair and its benefactors.&quot;" />
                    <outline text="&quot;The aim is to reconcile the principle of fair competition with the airports’ role in boosting small towns’ economies and keeping them connected to the outside world. State subsidies towards operating costs at airports handling over 200,000 passengers a year will be phased out over ten years, and charges to airlines must rise to compensate&quot;" />
                    <outline text="&quot;Mr O’Leary, in a rare show of assent with the Eurocrats, says the new rules are “terrific”. That may sound odd: their objective is to eliminate the state aid that flows to his airline. But Mr O’Leary is a realist, so he probably sees the new rules as the best he could hope for, given the pressure on the commission to ensure fairer competition.&quot;" />
                    <outline text="&quot;But if its new rules achieve this objective, the result will be that some smaller airports will find it hard to pay Ryanair and other low-cost carriers enough to keep them flying there. Many of the 80-odd European airports with fewer than 1m passengers will be at risk of closing, like Angoulême; in other cases passengers will face higher ticket prices. And some of Europe’s less-famous spots will see fewer tourists.&quot;" />

                  <outline text="&quot;Of course, these kinds of efforts are not solely the creation of a marketing team alarmed by unpleasant press—Ryanair has managed that for years—it’s mainly about bottom-line business. The airline has gotten to 80 million annual passengers and wants to boost that to 110 million by 2019. What worked to get this far, the airline has likely concluded, will not attract another 30 million customers on a continent where low-cost airlines have proliferated like rabbits.&quot;" _note="http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/bulletin/ryanair-really-is-getting-more-customer-friendly/32893" />

                  <outline text="&quot; Its business model minimises non-essential perks, maximises ancillary revenue, and involves flying to cheaper, secondary airports on the outskirts of its advertised destinations. &quot;" />

                  <outline text="COMMENTS:">
                    <outline text="&quot;In recent recession years there's been a huge number of business travellers who are not &quot;suits&quot; but who are entrepreneurs (small business owners) or employees of smaller companies for whom travel budget savings are significant. That means booking one's own flights, hotels and other travel arrangements. There's no &quot;corporate travel agency&quot;. Ryanair fits. It's not pleasant but it's a necessity.&quot;" />
                    <outline text="&quot;Actually, probably a bigger reason why Ryanair doesn't have more business travellers is that they don't sell via travel agencies. Most big corporations still have their travel managed by Travel Management Companies which prefer not to book on an airline's website if they can avoid it because it takes time and is not integrated with their back-office billing and accounting systems.&quot;" />

                  <outline text="&quot;founded in 1985 by the Ryan family as an alternative to the high fare duopoly, Aer Lingus and British Airways (Ryanair.com/da/about)&quot;" />
                  <outline text="&quot;due to deregulation of the air travel market by the European Union in 1997, Ryanair launched its first European routes and became a public company with a successful flotation on the Dublin and NASDAQ (New York) Stock Exchanges.&quot;" />
                  <outline text="&quot;. LCC‟s are characterized as offering short-haul routes, operating a single-aircraft type, operating from secondary airports, high frequency flights, avoiding transfer traffic, outsourcing functions when possible, offering buy-on-board catering and selling tickets through call-centers and websites&quot;" />
                  <outline text="Public Financing">
                    <outline text="&quot;Ryanair's policy is to serve airports only where authorities give them preferential treatment&quot;" />
                    <outline text="&quot; For example, in Belgium, the authorities have given Ryanair free office space and staff training (Noakes, 2003). As another example, Ryanair does not fly to Nice in France, because the authorities are not willing to give the airline better treatment than its competitors (Dobruszkes, 2006).&quot;" />

                  <outline text="The Website">
                    <outline text="&quot;Ryanair's website also makes out a significant physical resource in terms of revenue generation as 99 % of all sales are generated through the website where the customer has direct access to Ryanair‟s host reservation system (Ryanair Holdings PLC, 2009).Consequently, Ryanair has eliminated the cost of commissions to travel agents. Also, the airline plans to make check-in available exclusively through the website (ibid), thus eliminating the costs of airport kiosks and staff. Consequently, the website is valuable as it improves the company‟s efficiency and effectiveness by taking advantage of the opportunities the internet offers.&quot;" />

However, it's an increasingly elusive goal, according to US management expert, Prof Rita McGrath.&#10;McGrath, who is based at Columbia Business School but is a frequent visitor to these shores, says that organisations now need to find ways of leveraging temporary advantages and to remain fluid and innovative enough to change tack when those advantages no longer remain.&#10;Sony, Research In Motion (RIM) - the makers of BlackBerry - and Blockbuster video are examples of firms that have suffered for this very reason.&#10;&quot;Their downfall is a predictable outcome of practices that are designed around the concept of sustainable competitive advantage.&#10;&quot;The fundamental problem is that deeply ingrained structures and systems designed to extract maximum value from a competitive advantage become a liability when the environment requires instead the capacity to surf through waves of short-lived opportunities,&quot; she says.&#10;&quot;To compete in these more volatile and uncertain environments, you need to do things differently.&quot;&#10;Stability, not change, she says, is the state that is most dangerous in highly dynamic competitive environments. The presumption of stability creates all the wrong reflexes.&#10;It allows for inertia and power to build up around the existing business model. It also allows people to fall into routines and habits of mind and it creates the conditions for turf wars.&#10;&quot;Human beings like predictability and managers find comfort in knowing what the rules are but it fast moving markets, it just doesn't work anymore.&quot; she tells The Irish Times.&#10;However, two aspects of management which she says shouldn't change are the cultural values and strong leadership characteristics of organisations.&#10;The rapid change of the life cycle of advantages mirrors the shrinking in the time to mass adaptation of items such as popular consumer electronics.&#10;The telephone and television developed over a period that covered most of the 20th century yet the smartphone achieved mass adaptation in a period of less than five years. The internet has been a massive accelerator of this phenomenon across a whole range of categories of products and services, she agrees.&#10;One of the biggest changes in mind-set that is the need is to think of arenas rather than industries. The revolution in digital music is a case in point. Who could have predicted before the launch of iTunes that a computer company Apple would achieve such a pivotal position in the music business?&#10;Customer relationshipsThe arena concept also suggests that conventional ideas about what creates a long-lived advantage will change. Product features, new technologies, and the &quot;better mousetrap&quot; sources of advantage are proving to be less durable.&#10;Instead, companies are learning to leverage more ephemeral things such as deep customer relationships and the ability to design unique experiences across multiple arenas.&#10;In her latest book, The End of Competitive Advantage, McGrath distils the process by which a company creates a transient advantage. This starts with identifying an opportunity, allocating resources and assembling a team.&#10;If and when that opportunity gets traction, the firm must ramp up its advantage speedily. All going well, it can then enjoy a long period of exploitation where it can milk the profits. This period can be extended if the firm reconfigures its structure by changing management or shifting resources. Bigger pictureFinally, when the advantage is exhausted, there is a process of disengagement where a firm disposes of its assets by selling, shutting them down or re-purposing them.&#10;This should be done gracefully but quickly, she says, adding: &quot;This should not be confused with business failure. Disengagement can and should take place when a business is still viable, rather than when a desperate organisation has no choice.&quot;&#10;McGrath can see a downside to transient competitive advantage and says she worries that it may compound existing inequalities. Those most capable of exploiting short-term advantages, by their nature, are the rich and the most powerful.&#10;&quot;We see it in the fast food sector in the United States where analytics can tell you the precise hours and minutes you need workers in your restaurants to optimise your profits. You can't expect people to build a life around that,&quot; she observes.&#10;Good companies, she says, see the bigger picture. One of the companies she features in the book is Infosys, which hires for &quot;learnability&quot;, as one of its bosses told her. Employees spent 80 per cent of their time on defined core work task but the reaming 20 per cent is allocated to training and research efforts, she notes.&#10;Transient advantage has implications for how employees - as well as companies - manage career development, she says and she devotes a chapter of the book to how individuals need to see their own futures differently (see panel).&#10;&#10;http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;amp;risb=21_T18137039721&amp;amp;format=GNBFI&amp;amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;amp;startDocNo=1&amp;amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T18137039725&amp;amp;cisb=22_T18137039724&amp;amp;treeMax=true&amp;amp;treeWidth=0&amp;amp;selRCNodeID=6&amp;amp;nodeStateId=101en_GB,1&amp;amp;docsInCategory=3&amp;amp;csi=142626&amp;amp;docNo=3&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

Look at its moat; &#10;Firms with sustainable competitive advantages, or moats in investing parlance, can be attractive investments&#10;&#10;BYLINE: DAVID MILSTEAD, Special to the Globe and Mail&#10;&#10;SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: GLOBE INVESTOR COLUMN; STRATEGY; Pg. B10&#10;&#10;LENGTH: 1219 words&#10;&#10;Warren Buffett loves moats.&#10;Not the watery variety, mind you. The billionaire has long admired companies with competitive advantages that act as barriers to potential rivals. He likes to say that these fortunate companies have an &quot;economic moat.&quot;&#10;Investors have an obvious incentive to find and treasure such firms, but unfortunately Mr. Buffett is not in the business of pointing out the companies that have strong moats and those that don't. The Chicago-based research firm Morningstar is, however.&#10;Morningstar, which makes moat judgments a core part of its investment advice, has gone so far as to trademark the phrases &quot;economic moat&quot; and &quot;moat trend.&quot; It assigns moat ratings to every one of the 1,600-plus companies it covers.&#10;&quot;We were trying to find companies with strong, sustainable competitive advantages,&quot; says Morningstar's Heather Brilliant. &quot;We really felt like the term 'economic moat' fit, and it was something that could be popularized and used to a greater extent. So we started putting more research and rigour into determining whether a company has a moat or not.&quot;&#10;On first blush, the notion might seem gimmicky. But a closer look at Morningstar's moat analysis can help investors better understand a key question they should consider when evaluating any stock: Just how strong is a company's competitive position? And is it getting better or worse?&#10;Broadly speaking, companies with wide economic moats have &quot;the strongest possible competitive advantages,&quot; Matthew Coffina of Morningstar says. Companies with narrow economic moats also have strong competitive positions, he says, &quot;but we don't expect their advantages to last as long as those of wide-moat companies.&quot;&#10;Morningstar says an economic moat can be based on any one of several factors. Some firms - like Google or Facebook - benefit from a network effect that increases the value of their services as they attract more customers.&#10;Other companies build their moats on intangible assets like patents and brands. (Pepsi-Cola, for instance.) Still others find their competitive edge in a cost advantage, or their efficient scale. And some (like IT giant Oracle) get an edge from pricing power because their customers face too many costs in switching to another company.&#10;How do you tell if a company has a moat? If a firm consistently produces returns on invested capital that are greater than its peers for several years, that's a good sign, Ms. Brilliant says.&#10;The harder question, she adds, is determining how sustainable the moat will be - then figuring out if it's available to investors at the right price. &quot;Purely identifying companies with moats does not lead to excess returns,&quot; she says. &quot;What leads to excess returns is buying them at a discount.&quot;&#10;Calgary pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. is the only one out of 57 Canadian companies rated by Morningstar that has both a wide moat and a positive &quot;moat trend.&quot; A key part of its competitive edge is its scale: it has pipeline presences in the oil sands, the Bakken fields in the Midwest U.S., and in Cushing, Okla., as well as growth opportunities in natural gas and electricity.&#10;David McColl of Morningstar says Enbridge is just one of a handful of pipeline companies &quot;with the expertise, scale, access to capital, and geographic reach to successfully grow its pipeline transportation business.&quot; He raised his fair-value estimate for Enbridge shares this week to $54 (U.S.), compared to recent prices around $45.&#10;Canada's big telecoms, Rogers Communications Inc.,BCE Inc. and Telus Inc., all have narrow moats, according to Morningstar's analysis. But they're still considered attractive investments, despite competition from smaller wireless companies. Analyst Imari Love says Canada &quot;is one of [Morningstar's] favourite wireless markets, since it is dominated by three rational operators that value profit over market share.&quot;&#10;BCE and Rogers have stable moat trends, but Telus's trend is negative, according to Morningstar. &quot;Rogers (along with Telus and Bell), might have trouble winning the near-term margin battle - but its scale advantages, network superiority, and handset lineup put it in the pole position to win the long-term war,&quot; Mr. Love says.&#10;Mr. Love gives Telus a negative moat trend because of the deals BCE and Rogers have struck to acquire content for their wireless networks, &quot;a move that would push Telus further behind its peers.&quot;&#10;Mr. Love's fair value estimates are $60 for Rogers, $43 for BCE and $38 for Telus, giving Rogers &quot;the best risk/reward dynamic in the sector.&quot;&#10;Canadian Tire Corp. and Magna International Inc. are among the Canadian companies Morningstar has deemed moatless.&#10;Canadian Tire &quot;possesses the competitive advantages of convenience and high store-brand recognition,&quot; and has also implemented efficiency initiatives that will improve its position, the Morningstar retail analyst team says in a note.&#10;Still, the analysts say, &quot;We expect the increased competition from larger U.S.-based retailers, which have greater scale advantages, will pressure profit margins and returns on capital over the next decade.&quot; Morningstar's fair value estimate is $73 (Canadian), about current price levels.&#10;While Morningstar finds Canadian Tire's moat trend &quot;stable&quot; for now, Magna's is negative, the firm believes. The auto-parts supplier has lower margins than other global companies in its sector, and its returns, says analyst Richard Hilgert, &quot;have not been as impressive.&quot; His fair value estimate is $50 (U.S.), below recent levels.&#10;*********&#10;Mapping the moats&#10;Companies with wide economic moats possess competitive advantages that allow them to repel would-be rivals. Morningstar ranks not only the size of corporate moats but also the trend - whether the moats are growing or shrinking.&#10;&#10;&#10;http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;amp;risb=21_T18137266422&amp;amp;format=GNBFI&amp;amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;amp;startDocNo=1&amp;amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T18137266426&amp;amp;cisb=22_T18137266425&amp;amp;treeMax=true&amp;amp;treeWidth=0&amp;amp;csi=303830&amp;amp;docNo=8" />

Current growth rates alone are not enough to judge a company's long term growth potential, Martin explains in his book, &quot;Benjamin Graham and the Power of Growth Stocks&quot; (McGraw-Hill). &quot;Focusing solely on the prospects for growth while ignoring the quality of the underlying business model can be a dangerous investment proposition.&quot;&#10;It's not just the growth itself that determines the value of the stock, but the type of growth that really matters. Without a competitive advantage, there's no assurance that current growth will lead to future profits. As Benjamin Graham wrote in &quot;The Intelligent Investor,&quot; &quot;Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.&quot;&#10;In other words, not all growth is good growth. To prove his point, Graham referred to the airline industry of the 1940s and 1950s as a potent growth industry that routinely yielded disappointing returns for the airlines and their shareholders. In fact, airlines have continued to struggle despite rising demand for air travel. The industry lost nearly $40 billion between 1971 and 2009.&#10;Yet during that same period, one new competitor in the airline industry was able to generate $6.6 billion in PROFIT! Competing in the same industry with the same cost of goods, Southwest Airlines consistently made money while the airline giants teetered from one financial crisis to another. &quot;We can boil down Southwest's superior financial results to one critical difference,&quot; writes Martin, &quot;the strength of the business model. Southwest's business model was highly defensible; the others' were not.&quot;&#10;A DEFENSIBLE BUSINESS&#10;Martin considers a &quot;defensible business model&quot; to be &quot;the defining characteristic that sets great growth companies apart from the pack.&quot;&#10;But what, exactly, is a defensible business model?&#10;It is the moat the company builds around itself to ward off competition and ensure continued viability by relying on any one of a number of sustainable competitive advantages.&#10;&quot;From an investment perspective,&quot; explains Martin, &quot;the key characteristic of a company with a defensible business model is that the model enables the company to increase its intrinsic value at a much faster rate than companies with weak business models.&quot;&#10;The more solid the sustainability of the business model, the greater the chances the company will continue to grow. Since intrinsic current value is based on future growth, companies with a defensible business model command a premium in the market.&#10;How do you identify companies with a defensible business model? The first step is to look for a sustainable competitive advantage.&#10;SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE&#10;&quot;At its most rudimentary level, a sustainable competitive advantage is a durable and unique set of capabilities and industry dynamics that give the company a superior chance of winning with customers,&quot; explains Martin.&#10;There are several types of competitive advantages, including competitive barriers, operational excellence, return on investment, and tidal waves of opportunity.&#10;Investors sometime confuse competitive advantage with competitive &quot;strategy.&quot; Once you recognize the distinction between the two, it will be easier to identify companies with a true sustainable competitive advantage.&#10;&quot;A sustainable competitive advantage is structural in nature,&quot; explains Martin. &quot;It is not merely an endless series of tactical moves (such as price discounts or duplicable cost reductions) that allow a company to temporarily stay one step ahead of the competition, nor is it a unique long-term operating strategy. Sustainable competitive advantage is embedded in the underlying business model.&quot;&#10;&quot;Competitive strategy,&quot; he continues, &quot;is a choice. It speaks to how a company elects to compete in the marketplace. For instance, certain firms in an industry might strive to be the low-cost producer, while others may adopt a strategy geared toward offering premium products and services to a select group of clients. The permutations of competitive strategy are limitless; the expression of competitive advantage is not.&quot;&#10;A well-executed competitive strategy may enable a company to seize a competitive advantage where none existed before, but that possibility would be much harder to predict than simply identifying and investing in companies that already have a sustainable competitive advantage.&#10;Look at the leading companies across nearly every sector of the economy and you'll see that they all have a well-established competitive advantage that serves as a barrier to the competition.&#10;Competitive advantages typically take one of two forms, says Martin, &quot;barriers&quot; that keep potential customers out of the market, and &quot;handcuffs&quot; that keep their customers tied to their company.&#10;Here are several indicators of a competitive advantage to consider in identifying promising growth stocks:&#10; --  High and stable market share&#10; --  Steady market share gains&#10; --  Low frequency of exit or entrance of industry competitors&#10; --  Persistent pricing power&#10; --  Materially higher operating margins than direct competitors&#10; --  Loyal customers and low customer churn&#10; --  High repeat purchases&#10; --  Brand transferability to new categories&#10; --  Strong consumer routine or habit&#10; --  Long product cycles&#10; --  Robust domain expertise&#10; --  Proprietary manufacturing or business processes&#10;Download Table&#10;The next column will identify the hallmarks of operational excellence and the forces behind &quot;tidal waves of opportunity.&quot;&#10; --  High and stable market share&#10; --  Steady market share gains&#10; --  Low frequency of exit or entrance of industry competitors&#10; --  Persistent pricing power&#10; --  Materially higher operating margins than direct competitors&#10; --  Loyal customers and low customer churn&#10; --  High repeat purchases&#10; --  Brand transferability to new categories&#10; --  Strong consumer routine or habit&#10; --  Long product cycles&#10; --  Robust domain expertise&#10; --  Proprietary manufacturing or business processes&#10;Download Table&#10;SOURCE: Disciplined Growth Investors&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Media Contact: &#10;Evan Almeroth &#10;(612) 317-4114 &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;amp;risb=21_T18135136291&amp;amp;format=GNBFI&amp;amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;amp;startDocNo=1&amp;amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T18135136295&amp;amp;cisb=22_T18135136294&amp;amp;treeMax=true&amp;amp;treeWidth=0&amp;amp;csi=303830&amp;amp;docNo=2&#10;" />

It identifies key managerial levers, tools and systems that can be used to build and sustain a Hi-Technology company's core competences in order to facilitate a more innovative, collaborative 21st century corporate culture. A qualitative and quantitative assessment is made of how a firm's leadership, human capital management, organizational culture, design and systems can all collectively merge to create a more dynamic and responsive organization which is far more adept at building unique resources and capabilities, which can then be leveraged to create new market opportunities with high competitive entry barriers. &quot;&#10;&#10;" />

McGrath, which resonates with his beliefs. The article rebukes the classical premise of strategy equaling the attainment of a 'sustainable competitive advantage', and replacing it with that of pursuing 'transient competitive advantages'. This is a shift from capitalizing on a specific long-term competitive advantage in a well-defined industry, to fostering innovation-based temporal competitive advantages. A new strategy of continually adapting to changes in volatile and uncertain markets with new competitive advantages. It follows by elaborating on the deprecation of the sustainable competitive advantage strategy in the present by saying competitive advantages in most markets are quickly copied and customers readily move on to alternatives. We have to move from thinking competition lies only within industry and realizing it can come from anywhere.  A concept of ‘an arena’ is introduced to explain this different spectrum of competitors and change in conventional strategies of creating a lasting competitive advantage.

              <outline text="WS 1 Stereotypes">
                <outline text="Are Stereotypes True? - article" _note="Are African Americans really better at basketball than Caucasians? Are blonds really dumber than brunettes? Are women really worse at math than men? The short answer is yes. The longer answer is no. Let me explain by focusing on the stereotype that women can’t do math. At first glance, this stereotype seems to be true. For instance, men continue to outperform women on the math sections of the SAT and GRE, and men outnumber women in college math courses and math-related jobs. Surely this is evidence that women are not as good at math as men. But as this article will explain stereotypes are self-perpetuating and not only reflect but also cause performance differences between groups.&#10;&#10;For instance, if the stereotype that women are worse than men at math reflects true group differences, then women should always score worse than men on a math test, no matter how the test is presented. However, this is not the case. Spencer, Steele, and Quinn, (1999) found that when a math test was described as showing no previous gender differences in performance, women performed as well as men. When the test did not include this description, men outperformed women, implying that the stereotype itself causes stereotypic behavior. In fact, stereotypes reinforce stereotypical behavior by way of two psychological phenomena.&#10;&#10;The first phenomenon, which was briefly referred to by Regenberg (2007) on her article in In-Mind on the question whether blonds are really dumb, is called Stereotype Threat. Stereotype threat occurs when someone feels threatened by the possibility of confirming a negative stereotype about their group (Steele, 1997). Ironically, this concern leads to decreased performance, which in turn confirms the stereotype that the person was hoping to avoid. An example of stereotype threat is a when a woman, who considers herself good at math but is aware of the stereotype that women can’t do math, takes a difficult math test. When she encounters difficult questions and experiences frustration, she doesn’t want others to think she is struggling because she is a woman. She feels increased pressure to perform well, which actually works against her and makes her perform worse.&#10;&#10;The second phenomenon that reinforces stereotypic behavior is called Stereotype Lift . Walton and Cohen (2003) found that men’s scores were higher on math tests that were described as showing previous gender differences in performance compared to tests that were described as showing no previous gender differences. In other words, men experienced a boost in performance when gender stereotypes were relevant to the situation, compared to when they were irrelevant. Downward Social Comparison , a process whereby people elevate their self-esteem by comparing their group to a lower-status group, is thought to be the basis for this lift in performance (Wills , 1981). Men are able to boost their self-esteem and improve their math performance by comparing themselves to women, who are stereotypically believed to be worse at math than men. They may think to themselves, this test is difficult but at least I know I am better at math than women. However, when stereotypes are made irrelevant to the given test, men are no longer able to use this line of thinking to boost their self-esteem.&#10;&#10;Together, decreases in women’s scores caused by stereotype threat combined with increases in men’s scores caused by Stereotype Lift work together to exaggerate the performance differences found between men and women in math domains. These exaggerated performance differences confirm and perpetuate the stereotype that women can’t do math, and the cycle of stereotype threat and Stereotype Lift continues with even greater fervor. It is a vicious cycle: the stereotype causes gender differences in math performance; these differences in performance confirm the stereotype; the stereotype grows stronger and is even more likely to produce exaggerated group differences. As a result of the seemingly inevitability of male superiority in math domains, fewer women enter math-related jobs and college courses because they view their efforts as futile. They may think to themselves, what’s the use of pursuing a career in math if I’m not genetically wired to do math and will always be outperformed by my male colleagues? Instead, they may seek self-worth from success in areas in which women are not negatively stereotyped. The small number of women in math-related fields further confirms and perpetuates the stereotype. It seems to be a never-ending cycle, but the negative effects of stereotypes are not inevitable. First, certain factors must be present for stereotype threat to occur, and second, the negative effects of stereotype threat can be prevented." />

These advances lead to an intriguing proposition: that simply imagining intergroup interactions can produce more positive perceptions of outgroups. The authors discuss empirical research supporting the imagined contact proposition and ﬁnd it to be an approach that is at once deceptively simple and remarkably effective. Encouraging people to mentally simulate a positive intergroup encounter leads to improved outgroup attitudes and reduced stereotyping. It curtails intergroup anxiety and extends the attribution of perceivers’ positive traits to others. The authors describe the advantages and disadvantages of imagined contact compared to conventional strategies, outline an agenda for future research,  and discuss applications for policymakers and educators in&#10;their efforts to encourage more positive intergroup relations.">

            <outline text="Survey Feedbacks">
              <outline text="Individual Personality Trait - Big 5 " _note="Dear Dijon,&#10;&#10;in the first survey, we asked you to answer several scales about your&#10;personality. In the following, you will receive information about your&#10;own perception of your personality. Please note that this information is&#10;treated confidentially. Furthermore, there is no good or bad&#10;personality. It is rather important to reflect upon yourself. This might&#10;help you to find the right job (i.e., person-job fit) at the right&#10;company (i.e., person-organization fit). It might be also very helpful&#10;to understand the different &quot;characters&quot; in your team for your group&#10;observation exercise. Humans differ and it is important to accept this&#10;fact. Reflecting on personality concepts in general and your own in&#10;particular should be a first important step to know who you are and why&#10;sometimes &quot;others&quot; behave similar or different within a team or in the&#10;daily interactions.&#10;&#10;We will give you feedback on the Big 5 personality traits, on your level&#10;of need for closure, on your goal orientation, and on your need to&#10;belong. We shortly explain how these constructs are defined - what they&#10;are about. Subsequently, we will inform you about the average score of&#10;all IBA students. In this way, you can compare how you are doing in&#10;comparison to your peers in the classroom. Finally, your personal scores&#10;will be presented.&#10;&#10;&#10;(1)     The Big Five Model&#10;&#10;An impressive body of research supports that five basic dimensions&#10;underlie all other personality dimensions. The five basic dimensions&#10;are:&#10;&#10;Extraversion. Comfort level with relationships. Extroverts tend to be&#10;gregarious, assertive, and sociable. Introverts tend to be reserved,&#10;timid, and quiet.&#10;&#10;Agreeableness. Individual´s propensity to defer to others. High&#10;agreeableness people-cooperative, warm, and trusting. Low agreeableness&#10;people-cold, disagreeable, and raise their voice.&#10;&#10;Conscientiousness. A measure of reliability. A high conscientious person&#10;is responsible, organized, dependable, and persistent. Those who score&#10;low on this dimension are spontaneous, more chaotic, and easy-going.&#10;&#10;Emotional stability (or the reversed named Neuroticism). A person´s&#10;ability to withstand stress. People with positive emotional stability&#10;tend to be calm, self-confident, and secure. Those with high negative&#10;scores tend to be nervous, sensitive, more empathetic, and emotional.&#10;&#10;Openness to experience. The range of interests and fascination with&#10;novelty. Extremely open people are creative, curious, and artistically&#10;sensitive. Those at the other end of the openness category are&#10;conventional and find comfort in the familiar.&#10;&#10;These dimensions of our personality are neither negative nor positive in&#10;general. But they can be helpful in certain situations. In other words,&#10;sometimes high extraversion might be good, but in other contexts it&#10;might be actually rather negative. Thus the scores you receive do not&#10;indicate whether you have a good or bad personality. Rather, these&#10;scores inform you how you see yourself on these dimensions and what your&#10;personality might be. It might help you to find a job and an&#10;organization that fits to your personality.&#10;&#10;Below, we will provide you the mean scores of the course (i.e., all&#10;students of the IBA class). This helps to estimate in how your personal&#10;values are in relation to your peers (i.e., judgments are not made in&#10;relation to the mean of the scale).&#10;&#10;&#10;The Big Five Results&#10;&#10;The means of your peers are:&#10;Extraversion: 4.58&#10;Openness to experience: 4.69&#10;Agreeableness: 4.68&#10;Conscientiousness: 4.58&#10;Neuroticism (the opposite of emotional stability): 2.67&#10;&#10;Your personal scores are:&#10;Extraversion: 5&#10;Openess to experience: 5.4&#10;Agreeableness: 5.3&#10;Conscientousness: 4.9&#10;Neuroticism (the opposite of emotional stability): 2.8&#10;&#10;&#10;(2)     Need for cognitive closure&#10;&#10;An individual´s need for definite, unambiguous knowledge on an issue.&#10;People high in need for closure dislike being in a state of uncertainty&#10;and prefer to reach a conclusion or make a decision quickly and then&#10;stick to it. People low in need for closure tend to gather more&#10;information before they decide on a matter and are more likely to change&#10;their minds on it if they learn something new.&#10;&#10;The mean score of all students on need for cognitive closure is: 3.43&#10;&#10;Your personal score on need for cognitive closure is: 2.2&#10;&#10;&#10;(3)     Goal orientation&#10;&#10;Goal orientation is a &quot;disposition toward developing or demonstrating&#10;ability in achievement situations&quot; (VandeWalle, 1997). These goal&#10;orientations predict performance, goal setting, learning and leadership.&#10;Similar to the BIG 5, there is no good and bad. Rather, it depends on&#10;the circumstance what goal orientation is rather good or bad.&#10;&#10;Basically, there are two different goal orientations. Learning goal&#10;orientation means in how far a person is &quot;Focused on mastering&quot; new&#10;skills and knowledge. Thus, the more a person is learning oriented, the&#10;more the person wants to learn new skills and knowledge. In contrast,&#10;performance orientation is directed at performing tasks to achieve&#10;approval from peers (e.g., other students, friends) or teachers.&#10;Recently, these two goal orientations have been further differentiated&#10;in so called approach and avoidance focus. Thus, there is a learning&#10;approach and learning avoidance goal orientation as well as a&#10;performance approach and performance avoidance goal orientation.&#10;&#10;Learning-approach goal orientation &quot;entail striving to develop one's&#10;skills and abilities, advance one's learning, understand material, or&#10;complete or master a task&quot; (Elliott, 1999, p. 181). On the other hand,&#10;learning-avoidance goal orientation &quot;entail striving to avoid losing&#10;one's skills and abilities (or having their development stagnate),&#10;forgetting what one has learned, misunderstanding material, or leaving a&#10;task incomplete or unmastered&quot; (Elliott,1999, p. 181).&#10;&#10;Performance approach goal orientation is the &quot;desire to prove one's&#10;competence and to gain favorable judgments about it&quot; (VandeWalle, 1997,&#10;p.1000). Alternatively, performance avoidance goal orientation is the&#10;&quot;desire to avoid the disproving of one's competence and to avoid&#10;negative judgments about it&quot; (VandeWalle, 1997, p.1000).&#10;&#10;One important issue is that learning avoidance goal orientation has&#10;hardly been studied. Therefore, not much is known about its effects and&#10;whether it is a useful concept. However, the other types of goal&#10;orientation have been extensively researched. For an overview, you&#10;should read Payne, Toungcourt, &amp;amp; Beaubien, 2007). It seems that&#10;avoidance performance goals are the only ones that might potentially&#10;relate to some negative outcomes. Learning goal orientation is generally&#10;positive for self-efficacy, monitoring of learning progress, planning&#10;and goal setting. Further, high learning goal orientation seems to be&#10;better for academic performance than high performance goal orientation.&#10;In case you feel that your score is low on learning (approach) goal&#10;orientation, you can practice it by engaging in the material offered on&#10;blackboard or in the course more consciously. Thus, it is possible to&#10;change it.&#10;&#10;References&#10;Elliot, A. J. (1999). Approach and avoidance motivation and achievement&#10;goals.

It&#10;is part of Maslow´s need hierarchy (i.e., will be discussed in the&#10;motivation lecture) and predicts partly how portray ourselves towards&#10;others. People high in need to belong strive more for long-term and&#10;stable relationships. Further, these individuals are more likely to join&#10;social activities that imply social affiliations (i.e., team sport).&#10;People low in need to belong need less affiliation and can, therefore,&#10;act more on their own independent of other people. Thus, if you have a&#10;high score here, you should join some more of the social activities the&#10;university offers (e.g., sport teams, student societies, etc).&#10;&#10;The mean score of all students on need to belong is: 4.64&#10;&#10;Your personal score on need to belong is: 2.4" />
              <outline text="Dimensions of Culture" _note="Dear Dijon,&#10;&#10;Researchers have developed various dimensions to differentiate&#10;personalities of humans. Similarly, research has produced a significant&#10;amount of dimensions to differentiate groups based on their culture.&#10;While groups can be teams within organizations, most often we use the&#10;word &quot;culture&quot; in relation to national or ethnic groups. The OB book&#10;offers you a couple of theories that differentiate dimensions of&#10;culture. With the second survey, we also measured dimensions of culture.&#10;However, we extend it to some state-of-the-art dimensions used to&#10;differentiate culture. Again, there is no good and bad about these&#10;dimensions. Rather, they help you to accept and understand why people&#10;from different cultures might behave, feel and perceive differently than&#10;yourself. We will give you feedback of the average class score, the&#10;average score of the 4 largest nationalities in the classroom (Dutch,&#10;French, German, Chinese) and your own score. With this, you might be&#10;better able to understand potential differences in behavior within your&#10;teams or classroom.&#10;&#10;(1)     Horizontal and vertical dimensions of individualism and collectivism&#10;&#10;First, we measured horizontal as well as vertical collectivism and&#10;individualism (Singelis, Traindis, Bhawuk, Gelfand, 1995).&#10;&#10;&quot;Horizontal collectivism (H-C) is a cultural pattern in which the&#10;individual sees the self as an aspect of an in-group. That is, the self&#10;is merged with the members of the in-group, all of whom are extremely&#10;similar to each other. In this pattern, the self is interdependent and&#10;the same as the self of others. Equality is the essence of this&#10;pattern.&quot; (p.244)&#10;&#10;&quot;Vertical collectivism (V-C) is a cultural pattern in which the&#10;individual sees the self as an aspect of an in-group, but the members of&#10;the in-group are different from each other, some having more status than&#10;others. The self is interdependent and different from the self of&#10;others. Inequality is accepted in this pattern, and people do not see&#10;each other as the same. Serving and sacrificing for the in-group is an&#10;important aspect of this pattern.&quot; (p.244)&#10;&#10;&quot;Horizontal individualism (H-I) is a cultural pattern where an&#10;autonomous self is postulated, but the individual is more or less equal&#10;in status with others. The self is independent and the same as the self&#10;of others.&quot; (p.245)&#10;&#10;&quot;Vertical individualism (V-I) is a cultural pattern in which an&#10;autonomous self is postulated, but individuals see each other as&#10;different, and inequality is expected. The self is independent and&#10;different from the self of others. Competition is an important aspect of&#10;this pattern.&quot; (p.245)&#10;&#10;Singelis, T.M., Triandis, H.C., Bhawuk, D.P.S., &amp;amp; Gelfand, M.J.

Namely, a &quot;cultural variation that is dominating the&#10;geo-political landscape and has the potential to be a major source of&#10;cultural conflict: the difference between nations that are &quot;tight&quot;-have&#10;strong norms and a low tolerance of deviant behavior-and those that are&#10;&quot;loose&quot;-have weak norms and a high tolerance of deviant behavior.&quot; (p.&#10;1100). Research has indicated that this dimension is especially helpful&#10;in predicting ecological and historical threats between nations (e.g.,&#10;high population density, resource scarcity, a history of territorial&#10;conflict, and disease and environmental threats), or institutional&#10;regulations (e.g., autocracy, media regulations).&#10;&#10;Michele J.

These differences often are the sources of&#10;misunderstandings and conflicts. Therefore, it is important to be aware&#10;of these differences. We measured the two dimensions of ethical&#10;ideology: relativism and idealism (Forsyth, 1980). Relativism is a&#10;dimension reflecting the &quot;extent to which the individual rejects&#10;universal moral rules when drawing conclusions about moral questions,&#10;whereas others believe in and make use of moral absolutes&quot; (p. 175). In&#10;contrast, idealism refers to a dimension with the extremes of either&#10;believing that desirable actions can always be achieved with right&#10;action or believing that desirable actions will always be mixed with&#10;undesirable ones.&#10;&#10;Forsyth, D.

                        <outline text="Service-Oriented Architecture ?" _note="Stevey's Google Platforms Rant&#10;&#10;I was at Amazon for about six and a half years, and now I've been at Google for that long. One thing that struck me immediately about the two companies -- an impression that has been reinforced almost daily -- is that Amazon does everything wrong, and Google does everything right. Sure, it's a sweeping generalization, but a surprisingly accurate one. It's pretty crazy. There are probably a hundred or even two hundred different ways you can compare the two companies, and Google is superior in all but three of them, if I recall correctly. I actually did a spreadsheet at one point but Legal wouldn't let me show it to anyone, even though recruiting loved it.&#10;&#10;I mean, just to give you a very brief taste: Amazon's recruiting process is fundamentally flawed by having teams hire for themselves, so their hiring bar is incredibly inconsistent across teams, despite various efforts they've made to level it out. And their operations are a mess; they don't really have SREs and they make engineers pretty much do everything, which leaves almost no time for coding - though again this varies by group, so it's luck of the draw. They don't give a single shit about charity or helping the needy or community contributions or anything like that. Never comes up there, except maybe to laugh about it. Their facilities are dirt-smeared cube farms without a dime spent on decor or common meeting areas. Their pay and benefits suck, although much less so lately due to local competition from Google and Facebook. But they don't have any of our perks or extras -- they just try to match the offer-letter numbers, and that's the end of it. Their code base is a disaster, with no engineering standards whatsoever except what individual teams choose to put in place.&#10;&#10;To be fair, they do have a nice versioned-library system that we really ought to emulate, and a nice publish-subscribe system that we also have no equivalent for. But for the most part they just have a bunch of crappy tools that read and write state machine information into relational databases. We wouldn't take most of it even if it were free.&#10;&#10;I think the pubsub system and their library-shelf system were two out of the grand total of three things Amazon does better than google.&#10;&#10;I guess you could make an argument that their bias for launching early and iterating like mad is also something they do well, but you can argue it either way. They prioritize launching early over everything else, including retention and engineering discipline and a bunch of other stuff that turns out to matter in the long run. So even though it's given them some competitive advantages in the marketplace, it's created enough other problems to make it something less than a slam-dunk.&#10;&#10;But there's one thing they do really really well that pretty much makes up for ALL of their political, philosophical and technical screw-ups.&#10;&#10;Jeff Bezos is an infamous micro-manager. He micro-manages every single pixel of Amazon's retail site. He hired Larry Tesler, Apple's Chief Scientist and probably the very most famous and respected human-computer interaction expert in the entire world, and then ignored every goddamn thing Larry said for three years until Larry finally -- wisely -- left the company. Larry would do these big usability studies and demonstrate beyond any shred of doubt that nobody can understand that frigging website, but Bezos just couldn't let go of those pixels, all those millions of semantics-packed pixels on the landing page. They were like millions of his own precious children. So they're all still there, and Larry is not.&#10;&#10;Micro-managing isn't that third thing that Amazon does better than us, by the way. I mean, yeah, they micro-manage really well, but I wouldn't list it as a strength or anything. I'm just trying to set the context here, to help you understand what happened. We're talking about a guy who in all seriousness has said on many public occasions that people should be paying him to work at Amazon. He hands out little yellow stickies with his name on them, reminding people &quot;who runs the company&quot; when they disagree with him. The guy is a regular... well, Steve Jobs, I guess. Except without the fashion or design sense. Bezos is super smart; don't get me wrong. He just makes ordinary control freaks look like stoned hippies.&#10;&#10;So one day Jeff Bezos issued a mandate. He's doing that all the time, of course, and people scramble like ants being pounded with a rubber mallet whenever it happens. But on one occasion -- back around 2002 I think, plus or minus a year -- he issued a mandate that was so out there, so huge and eye-bulgingly ponderous, that it made all of his other mandates look like unsolicited peer bonuses.&#10;&#10;His Big Mandate went something along these lines:&#10;&#10;1) All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.&#10;&#10;2) Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.&#10;&#10;3) There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team's data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.&#10;&#10;4) It doesn't matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom protocols -- doesn't matter. Bezos doesn't care.&#10;&#10;5) All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.&#10;&#10;6) Anyone who doesn't do this will be fired.&#10;&#10;7) Thank you; have a nice day!&#10;&#10;Ha, ha! You 150-odd ex-Amazon folks here will of course realize immediately that #7 was a little joke I threw in, because Bezos most definitely does not give a shit about your day.&#10;&#10;#6, however, was quite real, so people went to work. Bezos assigned a couple of Chief Bulldogs to oversee the effort and ensure forward progress, headed up by Uber-Chief Bear Bulldog Rick Dalzell. Rick is an ex-Armgy Ranger, West Point Academy graduate, ex-boxer, ex-Chief Torturer slash CIO at Wal*Mart, and is a big genial scary man who used the word &quot;hardened interface&quot; a lot. Rick was a walking, talking hardened interface himself, so needless to say, everyone made LOTS of forward progress and made sure Rick knew about it.&#10;&#10;Over the next couple of years, Amazon transformed internally into a service-oriented architecture. They learned a tremendous amount while effecting this transformation. There was lots of existing documentation and lore about SOAs, but at Amazon's vast scale it was about as useful as telling Indiana Jones to look both ways before crossing the street. Amazon's dev staff made a lot of discoveries along the way. A teeny tiny sampling of these discoveries included:&#10;&#10;- pager escalation gets way harder, because a ticket might bounce through 20 service calls before the real owner is identified. If each bounce goes through a team with a 15-minute response time, it can be hours before the right team finally finds out, unless you build a lot of scaffolding and metrics and reporting.&#10;&#10;- every single one of your peer teams suddenly becomes a potential DOS attacker. Nobody can make any real forward progress until very serious quotas and throttling are put in place in every single service.&#10;&#10;- monitoring and QA are the same thing. You'd never think so until you try doing a big SOA. But when your service says &quot;oh yes, I'm fine&quot;, it may well be the case that the only thing still functioning in the server is the little component that knows how to say &quot;I'm fine, roger roger, over and out&quot; in a cheery droid voice. In order to tell whether the service is actually responding, you have to make individual calls. The problem continues recursively until your monitoring is doing comprehensive semantics checking of your entire range of services and data, at which point it's indistinguishable from automated QA. So they're a continuum.&#10;&#10;- if you have hundreds of services, and your code MUST communicate with other groups' code via these services, then you won't be able to find any of them without a service-discovery mechanism. And you can't have that without a service registration mechanism, which itself is another service. So Amazon has a universal service registry where you can find out reflectively (programmatically) about every service, what its APIs are, and also whether it is currently up, and where.&#10;&#10;- debugging problems with someone else's code gets a LOT harder, and is basically impossible unless there is a universal standard way to run every service in a debuggable sandbox.&#10;&#10;That's just a very small sample. There are dozens, maybe hundreds of individual learnings like these that Amazon had to discover organically. There were a lot of wacky ones around externalizing services, but not as many as you might think. Organizing into services taught teams not to trust each other in most of the same ways they're not supposed to trust external developers.&#10;&#10;This effort was still underway when I left to join Google in mid-2005, but it was pretty far advanced. From the time Bezos issued his edict through the time I left, Amazon had transformed culturally into a company that thinks about everything in a services-first fashion. It is now fundamental to how they approach all designs, including internal designs for stuff that might never see the light of day externally.&#10;&#10;At this point they don't even do it out of fear of being fired. I mean, they're still afraid of that; it's pretty much part of daily life there, working for the Dread Pirate Bezos and all. But they do services because they've come to understand that it's the Right Thing. There are without question pros and cons to the SOA approach, and some of the cons are pretty long. But overall it's the right thing because SOA-driven design enables Platforms.&#10;&#10;That's what Bezos was up to with his edict, of course. He didn't (and doesn't) care even a tiny bit about the well-being of the teams, nor about what technologies they use, nor in fact any detail whatsoever about how they go about their business unless they happen to be screwing up. But Bezos realized long before the vast majority of Amazonians that Amazon needs to be a platform.&#10;&#10;You wouldn't really think that an online bookstore needs to be an extensible, programmable platform. Would you?&#10;&#10;Well, the first big thing Bezos realized is that the infrastructure they'd built for selling and shipping books and sundry could be transformed an excellent repurposable computing platform. So now they have the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and the Amazon Elastic MapReduce, and the Amazon Relational Database Service, and a whole passel' o' other services browsable at aws.amazon.com. These services host the backends for some pretty successful companies, reddit being my personal favorite of the bunch.&#10;&#10;The other big realization he had was that he can't always build the right thing. I think Larry Tesler might have struck some kind of chord in Bezos when he said his mom couldn't use the goddamn website. It's not even super clear whose mom he was talking about, and doesn't really matter, because nobody's mom can use the goddamn website. In fact I myself find the website disturbingly daunting, and I worked there for over half a decade. I've just learned to kinda defocus my eyes and concentrate on the million or so pixels near the center of the page above the fold.&#10;&#10;I'm not really sure how Bezos came to this realization -- the insight that he can't build one product and have it be right for everyone. But it doesn't matter, because he gets it. There's actually a formal name for this phenomenon. It's called Accessibility, and it's the most important thing in the computing world.&#10;&#10;The. Most. Important. Thing.&#10;&#10;If you're sorta thinking, &quot;huh? You mean like, blind and deaf people Accessibility?&quot; then you're not alone, because I've come to understand that there are lots and LOTS of people just like you: people for whom this idea does not have the right Accessibility, so it hasn't been able to get through to you yet. It's not your fault for not understanding, any more than it would be your fault for being blind or deaf or motion-restricted or living with any other disability. When software -- or idea-ware for that matter -- fails to be accessible to anyone for any reason, it is the fault of the software or of the messaging of the idea. It is an Accessibility failure.&#10;&#10;Like anything else big and important in life, Accessibility has an evil twin who, jilted by the unbalanced affection displayed by their parents in their youth, has grown into an equally powerful Arch-Nemesis (yes, there's more than one nemesis to accessibility) named Security. And boy howdy are the two ever at odds.&#10;&#10;But I'll argue that Accessibility is actually more important than Security because dialing Accessibility to zero means you have no product at all, whereas dialing Security to zero can still get you a reasonably successful product such as the Playstation Network.&#10;&#10;So yeah. In case you hadn't noticed, I could actually write a book on this topic. A fat one, filled with amusing anecdotes about ants and rubber mallets at companies I've worked at. But I will never get this little rant published, and you'll never get it read, unless I start to wrap up.&#10;&#10;That one last thing that Google doesn't do well is Platforms. We don't understand platforms. We don't &quot;get&quot; platforms. Some of you do, but you are the minority. This has become painfully clear to me over the past six years. I was kind of hoping that competitive pressure from Microsoft and Amazon and more recently Facebook would make us wake up collectively and start doing universal services. Not in some sort of ad-hoc, half-assed way, but in more or less the same way Amazon did it: all at once, for real, no cheating, and treating it as our top priority from now on.&#10;&#10;But no. No, it's like our tenth or eleventh priority. Or fifteenth, I don't know. It's pretty low. There are a few teams who treat the idea very seriously, but most teams either don't think about it all, ever, or only a small percentage of them think about it in a very small way.&#10;&#10;It's a big stretch even to get most teams to offer a stubby service to get programmatic access to their data and computations. Most of them think they're building products. And a stubby service is a pretty pathetic service. Go back and look at that partial list of learnings from Amazon, and tell me which ones Stubby gives you out of the box. As far as I'm concerned, it's none of them. Stubby's great, but it's like parts when you need a car.&#10;&#10;A product is useless without a platform, or more precisely and accurately, a platform-less product will always be replaced by an equivalent platform-ized product.&#10;&#10;Google+ is a prime example of our complete failure to understand platforms from the very highest levels of executive leadership (hi Larry, Sergey, Eric, Vic, howdy howdy) down to the very lowest leaf workers (hey yo). We all don't get it. The Golden Rule of platforms is that you Eat Your Own Dogfood. The Google+ platform is a pathetic afterthought. We had no API at all at launch, and last I checked, we had one measly API call. One of the team members marched in and told me about it when they launched, and I asked: &quot;So is it the Stalker API?&quot; She got all glum and said &quot;Yeah.&quot; I mean, I was joking, but no... the only API call we offer is to get someone's stream. So I guess the joke was on me.&#10;&#10;Microsoft has known about the Dogfood rule for at least twenty years. It's been part of their culture for a whole generation now. You don't eat People Food and give your developers Dog Food. Doing that is simply robbing your long-term platform value for short-term successes. Platforms are all about long-term thinking.&#10;&#10;Google+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product. But that's not why they are successful. Facebook is successful because they built an entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do the work. So Facebook is different for everyone. Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars. Some spend all their time on Farmville. There are hundreds or maybe thousands of different high-quality time sinks available, so there's something there for everyone.&#10;&#10;Our Google+ team took a look at the aftermarket and said: &quot;Gosh, it looks like we need some games. Let's go contract someone to, um, write some games for us.&quot; Do you begin to see how incredibly wrong that thinking is now? The problem is that we are trying to predict what people want and deliver it for them.&#10;&#10;You can't do that. Not really. Not reliably. There have been precious few people in the world, over the entire history of computing, who have been able to do it reliably. Steve Jobs was one of them. We don't have a Steve Jobs here. I'm sorry, but we don't.&#10;&#10;Larry Tesler may have convinced Bezos that he was no Steve Jobs, but Bezos realized that he didn't need to be a Steve Jobs in order to provide everyone with the right products: interfaces and workflows that they liked and felt at ease with. He just needed to enable third-party developers to do it, and it would happen automatically.&#10;&#10;I apologize to those (many) of you for whom all this stuff I'm saying is incredibly obvious, because yeah. It's incredibly frigging obvious. Except we're not doing it. We don't get Platforms, and we don't get Accessibility. The two are basically the same thing, because platforms solve accessibility. A platform is accessibility.&#10;&#10;So yeah, Microsoft gets it. And you know as well as I do how surprising that is, because they don't &quot;get&quot; much of anything, really. But they understand platforms as a purely accidental outgrowth of having started life in the business of providing platforms. So they have thirty-plus years of learning in this space. And if you go to msdn.com, and spend some time browsing, and you've never seen it before, prepare to be amazed. Because it's staggeringly huge. They have thousands, and thousands, and THOUSANDS of API calls. They have a HUGE platform. Too big in fact, because they can't design for squat, but at least they're doing it.&#10;&#10;Amazon gets it. Amazon's AWS (aws.amazon.com) is incredible. Just go look at it. Click around. It's embarrassing. We don't have any of that stuff.&#10;&#10;Apple gets it, obviously. They've made some fundamentally non-open choices, particularly around their mobile platform. But they understand accessibility and they understand the power of third-party development and they eat their dogfood. And you know what? They make pretty good dogfood. Their APIs are a hell of a lot cleaner than Microsoft's, and have been since time immemorial.&#10;&#10;Facebook gets it. That's what really worries me. That's what got me off my lazy butt to write this thing. I hate blogging. I hate... plussing, or whatever it's called when you do a massive rant in Google+ even though it's a terrible venue for it but you do it anyway because in the end you really do want Google to be successful. And I do! I mean, Facebook wants me there, and it'd be pretty easy to just go. But Google is home, so I'm insisting that we have this little family intervention, uncomfortable as it might be.&#10;&#10;After you've marveled at the platform offerings of Microsoft and Amazon, and Facebook I guess (I didn't look because I didn't want to get too depressed), head over to developers.google.com and browse a little. Pretty big difference, eh? It's like what your fifth-grade nephew might mock up if he were doing an assignment to demonstrate what a big powerful platform company might be building if all they had, resource-wise, was one fifth grader.&#10;&#10;Please don't get me wrong here -- I know for a fact that the dev-rel team has had to FIGHT to get even this much available externally. They're kicking ass as far as I'm concerned, because they DO get platforms, and they are struggling heroically to try to create one in an environment that is at best platform-apathetic, and at worst often openly hostile to the idea.&#10;&#10;I'm just frankly describing what developers.google.com looks like to an outsider. It looks childish. Where's the Maps APIs in there for Christ's sake? Some of the things in there are labs projects. And the APIs for everything I clicked were... they were paltry. They were obviously dog food. Not even good organic stuff. Compared to our internal APIs it's all snouts and horse hooves.&#10;&#10;And also don't get me wrong about Google+. They're far from the only offenders. This is a cultural thing. What we have going on internally is basically a war, with the underdog minority Platformers fighting a more or less losing battle against the Mighty Funded Confident Producters.&#10;&#10;Any teams that have successfully internalized the notion that they should be externally programmable platforms from the ground up are underdogs -- Maps and Docs come to mind, and I know GMail is making overtures in that direction. But it's hard for them to get funding for it because it's not part of our culture. Maestro's funding is a feeble thing compared to the gargantuan Microsoft Office programming platform: it's a fluffy rabbit versus a T-Rex. The Docs team knows they'll never be competitive with Office until they can match its scripting facilities, but they're not getting any resource love. I mean, I assume they're not, given that Apps Script only works in Spreadsheet right now, and it doesn't even have keyboard shortcuts as part of its API. That team looks pretty unloved to me.&#10;&#10;Ironically enough, Wave was a great platform, may they rest in peace. But making something a platform is not going to make you an instant success. A platform needs a killer app. Facebook -- that is, the stock service they offer with walls and friends and such -- is the killer app for the Facebook Platform. And it is a very serious mistake to conclude that the Facebook App could have been anywhere near as successful without the Facebook Platform.&#10;&#10;You know how people are always saying Google is arrogant? I'm a Googler, so I get as irritated as you do when people say that. We're not arrogant, by and large. We're, like, 99% Arrogance-Free. I did start this post -- if you'll reach back into distant memory -- by describing Google as &quot;doing everything right&quot;. We do mean well, and for the most part when people say we're arrogant it's because we didn't hire them, or they're unhappy with our policies, or something along those lines. They're inferring arrogance because it makes them feel better.&#10;&#10;But when we take the stance that we know how to design the perfect product for everyone, and believe you me, I hear that a lot, then we're being fools. You can attribute it to arrogance, or naivete, or whatever -- it doesn't matter in the end, because it's foolishness. There IS no perfect product for everyone.&#10;&#10;And so we wind up with a browser that doesn't let you set the default font size. Talk about an affront to Accessibility. I mean, as I get older I'm actually going blind. For real. I've been nearsighted all my life, and once you hit 40 years old you stop being able to see things up close. So font selection becomes this life-or-death thing: it can lock you out of the product completely. But the Chrome team is flat-out arrogant here: they want to build a zero-configuration product, and they're quite brazen about it, and Fuck You if you're blind or deaf or whatever. Hit Ctrl-+ on every single page visit for the rest of your life.&#10;&#10;It's not just them. It's everyone. The problem is that we're a Product Company through and through. We built a successful product with broad appeal -- our search, that is -- and that wild success has biased us.&#10;&#10;Amazon was a product company too, so it took an out-of-band force to make Bezos understand the need for a platform. That force was their evaporating margins; he was cornered and had to think of a way out. But all he had was a bunch of engineers and all these computers... if only they could be monetized somehow... you can see how he arrived at AWS, in hindsight.&#10;&#10;Microsoft started out as a platform, so they've just had lots of practice at it.&#10;&#10;Facebook, though: they worry me. I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure they started off as a Product and they rode that success pretty far. So I'm not sure exactly how they made the transition to a platform. It was a relatively long time ago, since they had to be a platform before (now very old) things like Mafia Wars could come along.&#10;&#10;Maybe they just looked at us and asked: &quot;How can we beat Google? What are they missing?&quot;&#10;&#10;The problem we face is pretty huge, because it will take a dramatic cultural change in order for us to start catching up. We don't do internal service-oriented platforms, and we just as equally don't do external ones. This means that the &quot;not getting it&quot; is endemic across the company: the PMs don't get it, the engineers don't get it, the product teams don't get it, nobody gets it. Even if individuals do, even if YOU do, it doesn't matter one bit unless we're treating it as an all-hands-on-deck emergency. We can't keep launching products and pretending we'll turn them into magical beautiful extensible platforms later. We've tried that and it's not working.&#10;&#10;The Golden Rule of Platforms, &quot;Eat Your Own Dogfood&quot;, can be rephrased as &quot;Start with a Platform, and Then Use it for Everything.&quot; You can't just bolt it on later. Certainly not easily at any rate -- ask anyone who worked on platformizing MS Office. Or anyone who worked on platformizing Amazon. If you delay it, it'll be ten times as much work as just doing it correctly up front. You can't cheat. You can't have secret back doors for internal apps to get special priority access, not for ANY reason. You need to solve the hard problems up front.&#10;&#10;I'm not saying it's too late for us, but the longer we wait, the closer we get to being Too Late.&#10;&#10;I honestly don't know how to wrap this up. I've said pretty much everything I came here to say today. This post has been six years in the making. I'm sorry if I wasn't gentle enough, or if I misrepresented some product or team or person, or if we're actually doing LOTS of platform stuff and it just so happens that I and everyone I ever talk to has just never heard about it. I'm sorry.&#10;&#10;But we've gotta start doing this right." />

Writers will be based on a TSWriter oppinionated project. Include premium screencast and advice based on using these oppinionated modules. Also people can also include their personal ‘grunt/automation/setup.sh-like modules’ for uploading tumblr post, to facebook … et cetera a la ifttt.com . Another Writer Module addition could be Markdown writing with autogenerated blogpost. Additionally functionality of the starter (productivity/workflowy app) will be pomodorro(default task system, other modules for common agile methods like SCRUM for Software Devs / managing softwares integration). First develop it for the person, 1 indivual, in question and then upgrade it into a collaborative corporate software (a la Atlassion Software suites?). Focus on OpenSource for the basic app and additional functionalities as paid software upgrades. Functionalities shop (a la EverNote competitor?). Another component will be its android like, to the core customization possibility, hire any developer to customize the platform for you ( a la Wordpress opensourced business model, researhc!). A subset pomodoro cusotmization might be my  notes on #TheAdvisor &amp;amp; #BigIdea and workflowy customizations #workflowyClone . Another might be a HipChat like interface(or integration via API) but start out with my 1 man purposeful execution/activity logging incoporate in  Pomodorro(Subjective) Module by Dijon Kock(a sort a la 280daily realtime daily journal). Another Pomodorro module integration might be breakpassing - meditiation and music ( calm.com, raining.fm, coffitivity, 8tracks study/work playlists). An automator script might be: automated executionlog sumamry blogpost(simple bulletlist of primary accomplishments and starred things that day) - having the entire world (or company blogs) be able to see what you produce is a real motivator! being Reasoning/Competitor(evernote) distinquisher: Evernote isn’t for the wild, its not organized in a particular style, everyone has a particular style, generally there is a common style you could accept as a starting point and grow it as you wish (feature requests). That is the motivation behind &amp;lt;MyAppName&amp;gt;.  Another starter’s upgrade/inclusion could be google chrome history/bookmarks/Pocket-readlater integration(auto deciding to include in current pomodoro project time when your google that page and it pops up as a questioning to include in your realtime execution journal loggin, also include warnings or a mean nudge if you directing to a social network). Future perspective: Include #DisocverDotNet integration of this personal opensource (future collaborative) productivity/worflowy : its a Crazy Wild Mind Chaos Mollifier; in web community setting, responsive mobile first UX/UI design. A Student module/upgrade might include a feature for ANKI/SuperMEMO/DuolingoLike memory retention techniques and workflows integrated as a routine(grunted) in your personal app ecosystem ( like android shareable through other modules and automations etc, see Android Is Better article - ” Android intents let apps to interact with each other and share data. ” ).&#10;&#10;Make a Chrome App version?

When it runs, the function first&#10;* looks for a document element with an id of &quot;TOC&quot;. If there is no&#10;* such element it creates one at the start of the document.&#10;*&#10;* Next, the function finds all &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; through &amp;lt;h6&amp;gt; tags, treats them as&#10;* section titles, and creates a table of contents within the TOC&#10;* element. The function adds section numbers to each section heading&#10;* and wraps the headings in named anchors so that the TOC can link to&#10;* them. The generated anchors have names that begin with &quot;TOC&quot;, so&#10;* you should avoid this prefix in your own HTML.&#10;*&#10;* The entries in the generated TOC can be styled with CSS. All entries have&#10;* a class &quot;TOCEntry&quot;. Entries also have a class that corresponds to the level&#10;* of the section heading. &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; tags generate entries of class &quot;TOCLevel1&quot;,&#10;* &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt; tags generate entries of class &quot;TOCLevel2&quot;, and so on. Section numbers&#10;* inserted into headings have class &quot;TOCSectNum&quot;.&#10;*&#10;* You might use this module with a stylesheet like this:&#10;*&#10;* # TOC { border: solid black 1px; margin: 10px; padding: 10px; }&#10;* .TOCEntry { font-family: sans-serif; }&#10;* .TOCEntry a { text-decoration: none; }&#10;* .TOCLevel1 { font-size: 16pt; font-weight: bold; }&#10;* .TOCLevel2 { font-size: 12pt; margin-left: .5in; }&#10;* .TOCSectNum:after { content: &quot;: &quot;; }&#10;*&#10;* That final line generates a colon and space after section numbers. To hide&#10;* the section numbers, use this:&#10;*&#10;* .TOCSectNum { display: none }&#10;*&#10;* This module requires the onLoad() utility function.&#10;**/&#10;&#10;onLoad(function() { // Anonymous function defines a local scope&#10;	// Find the TOC container element.&#10;	// If there isn't one, create one at the start of the document.&#10;	var toc = document.getElementById(&quot;TOC&quot;);&#10;	if (!toc) {&#10;		toc = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);&#10;		toc.id = &quot;TOC&quot;;&#10;		document.body.insertBefore(toc, document.body.firstChild);&#10;	}&#10;&#10;	// Find all section heading elements&#10;	var headings;&#10;&#10;	if (document.querySelectorAll) // Can we do it the easy way?&#10;		headings = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6&quot;);&#10;	else // Otherwise, find the headings the hard way&#10;		headings = findHeadings(document.body, []);&#10;	&#10;	// Recursively traverse the document body looking for headings&#10;	function findHeadings(root, sects) {&#10;		for(var c = root.firstChild; c != null; c = c.nextSibling) {&#10;			if (c.nodeType !== 1) continue;&#10;			if (c.tagName.length == 2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; c.tagName.charAt(0) == &quot;H&quot;)&#10;				sects.push(c);&#10;			else&#10;			findHeadings(c, sects);&#10;		}&#10;		return sects;&#10;	}&#10;	&#10;	// Initialize an array that keeps track of section numbers.&#10;	var sectionNumbers = [0,0,0,0,0,0];&#10;	&#10;	// Now loop through the section header elements we found.&#10;	for(var h = 0; h &amp;lt; headings.length; h++) {&#10;		var heading = headings[h];&#10;&#10;		// Skip the section heading if it is inside the TOC container.&#10;		if (heading.parentNode == toc) continue;&#10;&#10;		// Figure out what level heading it is.&#10;		var level = parseInt(heading.tagName.charAt(1));&#10;		if (isNaN(level) || level &amp;lt; 1 || level &amp;gt; 6) continue;&#10;		&#10;		// Increment the section number for this heading level&#10;		// and reset all lower heading level numbers to zero.&#10;		sectionNumbers[level-1]++;&#10;		for(var i = level; i &amp;lt; 6; i++) sectionNumbers[i] = 0;&#10;		&#10;		// Now combine section numbers for all heading levels&#10;		// to produce a section number like 2.3.1.&#10;		var sectionNumber = sectionNumbers.slice(0,level).join(&quot;.&quot;)&#10;		&#10;		// Add the section number to the section header title.&#10;		// We place the number in a &amp;lt;span&amp;gt; to make it styleable.&#10;		var span = document.createElement(&quot;span&quot;);&#10;		span.className = &quot;TOCSectNum&quot;;&#10;		span.innerHTML = sectionNumber;&#10;		heading.insertBefore(span, heading.firstChild);&#10;&#10;		// Wrap the heading in a named anchor so we can link to it.&#10;		var anchor = document.createElement(&quot;a&quot;);&#10;		anchor.name = &quot;TOC&quot;+sectionNumber;&#10;		heading.parentNode.insertBefore(anchor, heading);&#10;		anchor.appendChild(heading);&#10;&#10;		// Now create a link to this section.&#10;		var link = document.createElement(&quot;a&quot;);&#10;		link.href = &quot;#TOC&quot; + sectionNumber; // Link destination&#10;		link.innerHTML = heading.innerHTML; // Link text is same as heading&#10;&#10;		// Place the link in a div that is styleable based on the level.&#10;		var entry = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);&#10;		entry.className = &quot;TOCEntry TOCLevel&quot; + level;&#10;		entry.appendChild(link);&#10;&#10;		// And add the div to the TOC container.&#10;		toc.appendChild(entry);&#10;	}&#10;});&#10;&#10;">

Ik zal misschien ook verder een parttime werk willben doen naast mijn studie maar eerst lijk mijn een proef bij zomberbaan bij jullie en goeie begin. Ik will bij jullie werken omdat ik echt veel houd van koken. Het koken is een van mijn leukste hobbies waar ik van lekker vers eten kan genieten. Ik ben zo een healthy, real food, eater en hou dus ook van elke keer nieuwe recepten proberen. Ik zou het dus een leuke uitdaging vinden om bij La Place te werken waar ik dagelijks vers eten kan bereiden en hopelijk meer leert over koken en de horeca sector. Doordat La Place ook zo een groot nationale bedrijf is zal ervaring bij jullie waardevol zijn voor mijn carriere, en dat vindt ik belangerijk. Ik ben een hard werker en zou mijn best doen om kwaliteitsvole resultaten op tijd te leveren. " />

Ik begin elke werkdag met veel energy en probeer mijn uiterste best te doen door niet alleen mijn taak te doen maar als ik iets out of place ziet ik de management laat weten en goed communicatie met hun. Ik probeer elke werkdag een 'review' van de management te krijgen hoe ik gedaan heb en wat ik beter zou kunnen doen volgende keer. Ik neem initiaf als nodig is waar er een situatie tijdens werk is die niemand weet wat te doen, pak ik aan om snel oplossing te vinden. Tijdens winkelopentijd doe ik mijn werk maar tegenlijkertijd ben ik altijd 'smiling' met de mentaliteit van customer first and probeer als ik gevragen wordt iederen te hulpen en als ik iets nieet weet zeg ik ze excuse mij maar ik weet het niet maar ik kan wel even snel voor u gaan kijken. Dan ga ik bij de teamleider of meer expierneced medewerker antwoord vragen. Take initiatief. Extra hard werken en probeer uit te steken. Team members motiveren. Gezellige sfeer maar altijd concentreet op het werk. Leeuk doen maar altijd in de grens efficiency. Sorry dat mijn nederlands misschien niet perfect is; ik ben engelstalig. Goede communicatie met medewerkers. Goeie sfeer mits productivieteit hoog is. Ik ben een productiviteit junkie vrije tijd alles organiseert goed in order, systematisch met school en alles wat ik doe, makkelijk die houding modificeren voor een leidership positie. Die character neem ik mee en streef ik naar (*use management terms - review greys anatomy board meeting talk about fincance, customer retention, etc)" />

          <outline text="Letter to my Daughter/Son" _note="Dear Cutie-Pie,&#10;&#10;Recently, your mother and I were searching for an answer on Google. Halfway through entering the question, Google returned a list of the most popular searches in the world. Perched at the top of the list was “How to keep him interested.”&#10;&#10;It startled me. I scanned several of the countless articles about how to be sexy and sexual, when to bring him a beer versus a sandwich, and the ways to make him feel smart and superior.&#10;&#10;And I got angry.&#10;&#10;Little One, it is not, has never been, and never will be your job to “keep him interested.”&#10;&#10;Little One, your only task is to know deeply in your soul—in that unshakeable place that isn’t rattled by rejection and loss and ego—that you are worthy of interest. (If you can remember that everyone else is worthy of interest also, the battle of your life will be mostly won. But that is a letter for another day.)&#10;&#10;If you can trust your worth in this way, you will be attractive in the most important sense of the word: you will attract a boy who is both capable of interest and who wants to spend his one life investing all of his interest in you.&#10;&#10;Little One, I want to tell you about the boy who doesn’t need to be keptinterested, because he knows you are interesting:&#10;&#10;I don’t care if he puts his elbows on the dinner table—as long as he puts his eyes on the way your nose scrunches when you smile. And then can’t stop looking.&#10;&#10;I don’t care if he can’t play a bit of golf with me—as long as he can play with the children you give him and revel in all the glorious and frustrating ways they are just like you.&#10;&#10;I don’t care if he doesn’t follow his wallet—as long as he follows his heart and it always leads him back to you.&#10;&#10;I don’t care if he is strong—as long as he gives you the space to exercise the strength that is in your heart.&#10;&#10;I couldn’t care less how he votes—as long as he wakes up every morning and daily elects you to a place of honor in your home and a place of reverence in his heart.&#10;&#10;I don’t care about the color of his skin—as long as he paints the canvas of your lives with brushstrokes of patience, and sacrifice, and vulnerability, and tenderness.&#10;&#10;I don’t care if he was raised in this religion or that religion or no religion—as long as he was raised to value the sacred and to know every moment of life, and every moment of life with you, is deeply sacred.&#10;&#10;In the end, Little One, if you stumble across a man like that and he and I have nothing else in common, we will have the most important thing in common:&#10;&#10;You.&#10;&#10;Because in the end, Little One, the only thing you should have to do to “keep him interested” is to be you.&#10;&#10;Your eternally interested guy,&#10;&#10;Daddy" />
